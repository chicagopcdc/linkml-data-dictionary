Doxorubicin, isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius, is the hydroxylated congener of daunorubicin. Doxorubicin intercalates between base pairs in the DNA helix, thereby preventing DNA replication and ultimately inhibiting protein synthesis. Additionally, doxorubicin inhibits topoisomerase II which results in an increased and stabilized cleavable enzyme-DNA linked complex during DNA replication and subsequently prevents the ligation of the nucleotide strand after double-strand breakage. Doxorubicin also forms oxygen free radicals resulting in cytotoxicity secondary to lipid peroxidation of cell membrane lipids; the formation of oxygen free radicals also contributes to the toxicity of the anthracycline antibiotics, namely the cardiac and cutaneous vascular effects.",

Some types make the stomach smaller, which decreases the amount of food that it can hold so the person feels full sooner and eats less. Other types make changes to the stomach and the small intestine, which decreases the nutrients and calories that are absorbed from food. Weight loss surgery can improve many obesity-related health problems, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, unhealthy cholesterol levels, sleep apnea, and knee, hip, or other body pain. Having weight loss surgery may also decrease the risk of some cancers, including endometrial cancer. Also called bariatric surgery. (Source: NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms)",

Peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) is used for the treatment of certain blood disorders, following partial or complete bone marrow ablation, or following high dose chemotherapy or radiation treatment for cancer. Immature circulating blood cells, similar to stem cells in the bone marrow, are removed before treatment. The cells are then given to the patient after treatment to help the bone marrow recover and continue producing healthy blood cells. Transplantation may be autologous (the patient's own blood cells are used), allogeneic (blood cells are donated by someone else), or syngeneic (blood cells are donated by an identical twin).",

It is an organ essential for the development of the immune system. Its function is the maturation of the progenitor lymphoid cells to thymocytes and subsequently to mature T-cells.

Transiently activated during lymphocyte activation, CD30 (tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 8;TNFRSF8) may be constitutively expressed in hematologic malignancies including Hodgkin lymphoma and some T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas.

Additionally, doxorubicin inhibits topoisomerase II which results in an increased and stabilized cleavable enzyme-DNA linked complex during DNA replication and subsequently prevents the ligation of the nucleotide strand after double-strand breakage. Doxorubicin also forms oxygen free radicals resulting in cytotoxicity secondary to lipid peroxidation of cell membrane lipids; the formation of oxygen free radicals also contributes to the toxicity of the anthracycline antibiotics, namely the cardiac and cutaneous vascular effects.",

Common leukemias include acute myeloid leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic or precursor lymphoblastic leukemia, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
