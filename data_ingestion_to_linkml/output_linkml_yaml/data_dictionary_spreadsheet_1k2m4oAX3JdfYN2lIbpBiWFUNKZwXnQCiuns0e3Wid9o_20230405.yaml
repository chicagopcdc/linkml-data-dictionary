          intercalates between base pairs in the DNA helix, thereby preventing DNA
          replication and ultimately inhibiting protein synthesis. Additionally, doxorubicin
          inhibits topoisomerase II which results in an increased and stabilized cleavable
          enzyme-DNA linked complex during DNA replication and subsequently prevents
          the ligation of the nucleotide strand after double-strand breakage. Doxorubicin
          also forms oxygen free radicals resulting in cytotoxicity secondary to lipid
          peroxidation of cell membrane lipids; the formation of oxygen free radicals
          also contributes to the toxicity of the anthracycline antibiotics, namely

          breaks, arrest of the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle, and cell death. This
          agent's cytotoxicity is maximal during the S phase of the cell cycle when
          topoisomerase levels are greatest. In addition, amsacrine may induce transcription
          of tumor promoter p53 protein and block p53 ubiquitination and proteasomal

          Bortezomib reversibly inhibits the 26S proteasome, a large protease complex
          that degrades ubiquinated proteins. By blocking the targeted proteolysis
          normally performed by the proteasome, bortezomib disrupts various cell signaling
          pathways, leading to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and inhibition of angiogenesis.
          Specifically, the agent inhibits nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, a protein that
          is constitutively activated in some cancers, thereby interfering with NF-kappaB-mediated
          cell survival, tumor growth, and angiogenesis. In vivo, bortezomib delays

          cyclophosphamide is converted to the active metabolites aldophosphamide
          and phosphoramide mustard, which bind to DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA replication

          DNA replication and repair and RNA and protein synthesis.
        meaning: ncit:C62091
      Daunorubicin (Liposomal):
        description: A liposome-encapsulated form of the citrate salt of the anthracycline
          antineoplastic antibiotic daunorubicin. Daunorubicin intercalates into DNA
          and interacts with topoisomerase II, thereby inhibiting DNA replication
          and repair and RNA and protein synthesis. Liposomal delivery of doxorubicin
          citrate improves drug penetration into tumors and decreases drug clearance,
          thereby increasing the duration of therapeutic drug effects.
        meaning: ncit:C2213
      Daunorubicin and Cytarabine (Liposomal):
        description: A liposomal formulation containing a fixed combination of the
          antineoplastic agents cytarabine and daunorubicin in a 5:1 molar ratio.
          Liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine has been designed to provide
          optimal delivery of a specific ratio of cytarabine to daunorubicin, one
          that has been shown to be synergistic in vitro. The antimetabolite cytarabine
          competes with cytidine for incorporation into DNA, inhibiting DNA synthesis.
          This agent also inhibits DNA polymerase, resulting in a decrease in DNA
          replication and repair. Daunorubicin, an intercalator and a topoisomerase
          II inhibitor, prevents DNA replication and inhibits protein synthesis. This
          agent also generates oxygen free radicals, resulting in the cytotoxic lipid
          peroxidation of cell membrane lipids.

      Dexrazoxane:
        description: A bisdioxopiperazine with iron-chelating, chemoprotective, cardioprotective,
          and antineoplastic activities. After hydrolysis to an active form that is
          similar to ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), dexrazoxane chelates
          iron, limiting the formation of free radical-generating anthracycline-iron
          complexes, which may minimize anthracycline-iron complex-mediated oxidative
          damage to cardiac and soft tissues. This agent also inhibits the catalytic
          activity of topoisomerase II, which may result in tumor cell growth inhibition.
        meaning: ncit:C1333
      Doxorubicin:
        description: An anthracycline antibiotic with antineoplastic activity. Doxorubicin,
          isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius, is the
          hydroxylated congener of daunorubicin. Doxorubicin intercalates between
          base pairs in the DNA helix, thereby preventing DNA replication and ultimately
          inhibiting protein synthesis. Additionally, doxorubicin inhibits topoisomerase
          II which results in an increased and stabilized cleavable enzyme-DNA linked
          complex during DNA replication and subsequently prevents the ligation of
          the nucleotide strand after double-strand breakage. Doxorubicin also forms
          oxygen free radicals resulting in cytotoxicity secondary to lipid peroxidation
          of cell membrane lipids; the formation of oxygen free radicals also contributes
          to the toxicity of the anthracycline antibiotics, namely the cardiac and
          cutaneous vascular effects.
        meaning: ncit:C456
      Etoposide:
        description: A semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin, a substance extracted
          from the mandrake root Podophyllum peltatum. Possessing potent antineoplastic
          properties, etoposide binds to and inhibits topoisomerase II and its function
          in ligating cleaved DNA molecules, resulting in the accumulation of single-
          or double-strand DNA breaks, the inhibition of DNA replication and transcription,
          and apoptotic cell death. Etoposide acts primarily in the G2 and S phases
          of the cell cycle. (NCI04)

      Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin:
        description: A recombinant, humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody attached
          to the cytotoxic antitumor antibiotic calicheamicin. In this conjugate,
          the antibody binds to and is internalized by tumor cells expressing CD33
          antigen (a sialic acid-dependent glycoprotein commonly found on the surface
          of leukemic blasts), thereby delivering the attached calicheamicin to CD33-expressing
          tumor cells. Calicheamicin binds to the minor groove of DNA, causing double
          strand DNA breaks and resulting in inhibition of DNA synthesis. (NCI04)
        meaning: ncit:C1806
      Gilteritinib:
        description: An orally bioavailable inhibitor of the receptor tyrosine kinases
          (RTKs) FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3, STK1, or FLK2), AXL (UFO or
          JTK11) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK or CD246), with potential antineoplastic
          activity. Gilteritinib binds to and inhibits both the wild-type and mutated
          forms of FLT3, AXL and ALK. This may result in an inhibition of FLT3, AXL,
          and ALK-mediated signal transduction pathways and reduces tumor cell proliferation
          in cancer cell types that overexpress these RTKs. FLT3, AXL and ALK, overexpressed
          or mutated in a variety of cancer cell types, play a key role in tumor cell
          growth and survival.

      Hydrocortisone Sodium Succinate:
        description: The sodium salt of hydrocortisone succinate with glucocorticoid
          property. Hydrocortisone sodium succinate is chemically similar to the endogenous
          hormone that stimulates anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities,
          in addition to exhibiting minor mineralocorticoid effects. This agent binds
          to intracellular glucocorticoid receptors and is translocated into the nucleus,
          where it initiates the transcription of glucocorticoid-responsive genes,
          such as various cytokines and lipocortins. Lipocortins inhibit phospholipase
          A2, thereby blocking the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids
          and preventing the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, both potent
          mediators of inflammation.
        meaning: ncit:C1819

          dihydrofolate reductase, resulting in inhibition of purine nucleotide and
          thymidylate synthesis and, subsequently, inhibition of DNA and RNA syntheses.
          Methotrexate also exhibits potent immunosuppressant activity although the
          mechanism(s) of actions is unclear.
        meaning: ncit:C642
      Midostaurin:

          kinase C alpha (PKCalpha), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2
          (VEGFR2), c-kit, platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) and FMS-like
          tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) tyrosine kinases, which may result in disruption
          of the cell cycle, inhibition of proliferation, apoptosis, and inhibition
          of angiogenesis in susceptible tumors.
        meaning: ncit:C1872
      Quizartinib:
        description: An orally available small molecule with potential antineoplastic

          including FMS-related tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3/STK1), colony-stimulating
          factor 1 receptor (CSF1R/FMS), stem cell factor receptor (SCFR/KIT), and
          platelet derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRs), resulting in inhibition
          of ligand-independent leukemic cell proliferation and apoptosis. Mutations
          in FLT3, resulting in constitutive activation, are the most frequent genetic
          alterations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and occur in approximately one-third
          of AML cases.
        meaning: ncit:C68936
      Sorafenib:
        description: A synthetic compound targeting growth signaling and angiogenesis.
          Sorafenib blocks the enzyme RAF kinase, a critical component of the RAF/MEK/ERK
          signaling pathway that controls cell division and proliferation; in addition,
          sorafenib inhibits the VEGFR-2/PDGFR-beta signaling cascade, thereby blocking

          derivative of N,N',N''-triethylenephosphoramide (TEPA), with antineoplastic
          activity. Upon administration, thiotepa is converted into highly reactive
          ethylenimine groups, which covalently bind to nucleophilic groups in DNA
          and demonstrate a preference for the N7 position of guanine bases. This
          induces crosslinking of alkylated guanine bases in double-stranded DNA,
          interferes with both DNA replication and cell division, and results in both
          the induction of apoptosis and the inhibition of cell growth.
        meaning: ncit:C875
      Tretinoin:
        description: A naturally-occurring acid of retinol. Tretinoin binds to and
          activates retinoic acid receptors (RARs), thereby inducing changes in gene
          expression that lead to cell differentiation, decreased cell proliferation,
          and inhibition of tumorigenesis. This agent also inhibits telomerase, resulting
          in telomere shortening and eventual apoptosis of some tumor cell types.
          The oral form of tretinoin has teratogenic and embryotoxic properties.
        meaning: ncit:C900

      Carboplatin:
        description: A second-generation platinum compound with a broad spectrum of
          antineoplastic properties. Carboplatin contains a platinum atom complexed
          with two ammonia groups and a cyclobutane-dicarboxyl residue. This agent
          is activated intracellularly to form reactive platinum complexes that bind
          to nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich sites in DNA, thereby inducing intrastrand
          and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as DNA-protein cross-links. These
          carboplatin-induced DNA and protein effects result in apoptosis and cell
          growth inhibition. This agent possesses tumoricidal activity similar to
          that of its parent compound, cisplatin, but is more stable and less toxic.
          (NCI04)
        meaning: ncit:C1282
      Cisplatin:
        description: An alkylating-like inorganic platinum agent (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum)
          with antineoplastic activity. Cisplatin forms highly reactive, charged,
          platinum complexes which bind to nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich sites
          in DNA inducing intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as
          DNA-protein cross-links. These cross-links result in apoptosis and cell
          growth inhibition.
        meaning: ncit:C376
      Erlotinib:
        description: A quinazoline derivative with antineoplastic properties. Competing
          with adenosine triphosphate, erlotinib reversibly binds to the intracellular
          catalytic domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase,
          thereby reversibly inhibiting EGFR phosphorylation and blocking the signal
          transduction events and tumorigenic effects associated with EGFR activation.
        meaning: ncit:C65530
      Gemcitabine:
        description: A broad-spectrum antimetabolite and deoxycytidine analogue with
          antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, gemcitabine is converted into
          the active metabolites difluorodeoxycytidine diphosphate (dFdCDP) and difluorodeoxycytidine
          triphosphate (dFdCTP) by deoxycytidine kinase. dFdCTP competes with deoxycytidine
          triphosphate (dCTP) and is incorporated into DNA. This locks DNA polymerase
          thereby resulting in "masked termination" during DNA replication. On the
          other hand, dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, thereby decreasing
          the deoxynucleotide pool available for DNA synthesis. The reduction in the
          intracellular concentration of dCTP potentiates the incorporation of dFdCTP
          into DNA.
        meaning: ncit:C66876
      Ifosfamide:
        description: A synthetic analogue of the nitrogen mustard cyclophosphamide
          with antineoplastic activity. Ifosfamide alkylates and forms DNA crosslinks,
          thereby preventing DNA strand separation and DNA replication. This agent
          is a prodrug that must be activated through hydroxylation by hepatic microsomal
          enzymes. (NCI04)
        meaning: ncit:C564
      Irinotecan:
        description: A semisynthetic derivative of camptothecin, a cytotoxic, quinoline-based
          alkaloid extracted from the Asian tree Camptotheca acuminata. Irinotecan,
          a prodrug, is converted to a biologically active metabolite 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin
          (SN-38) by a carboxylesterase-converting enzyme. One thousand-fold more
          potent than its parent compound irinotecan, SN-38 inhibits topoisomerase
          I activity by stabilizing the cleavable complex between topoisomerase I
          and DNA, resulting in DNA breaks that inhibit DNA replication and trigger
          apoptotic cell death. Because ongoing DNA synthesis is necessary for irinotecan
          to exert its cytotoxic effects, it is classified as an S-phase-specific
          agent.
        meaning: ncit:C62040
      Isotretinoin:
        description: A naturally-occurring retinoic acid with potential antineoplastic
          activity. Isotretinoin binds to and activates nuclear retinoic acid receptors
          (RARs); activated RARs serve as transcription factors that promote cell
          differentiation and apoptosis. This agent also exhibits immunomodulatory
          and anti-inflammatory responses and inhibits ornithine decarboxylase, thereby
          decreasing polyamine synthesis and keratinization.
        meaning: ncit:C603
      Lomustine:
        description: A nitrosourea with antineoplastic activity. Lomustine alkylates

          also carbamoylates DNA and proteins, resulting in inhibition of DNA and
          RNA synthesis and disruption of RNA processing. Lomustine is lipophilic
          and crosses the blood-brain barrier. (NCI04)
        meaning: ncit:C617
      Pemetrexed:
        description: A synthetic pyrimidine-based antifolate. Pemetrexed binds to

          of 2'-deoxyuridine-5'-monophosphate (dUMP) to 2'-deoxythymidine-5'-monophosphate
          (dTMP), an essential precursor in DNA synthesis.
        meaning: ncit:C61614
      Temozolomide:
        description: A triazene analog of dacarbazine with antineoplastic activity.
          As a cytotoxic alkylating agent, temozolomide is converted at physiologic
          pH to the short-lived active compound, monomethyl triazeno imidazole carboxamide
          (MTIC). The cytotoxicity of MTIC is due primarily to methylation of DNA
          at the O6 and N7 positions of guanine, resulting in inhibition of DNA replication.
          Unlike dacarbazine, which is metabolized to MITC only in the liver, temozolomide
          is metabolized to MITC at all sites. Temozolomide is administered orally
          and penetrates well into the central nervous system. (NCI04)
        meaning: ncit:C1244
      Topotecan:
        description: A semisynthetic derivative of camptothecin, a cytotoxic, quinoline-based
          alkaloid extracted from the Asian tree Camptotheca acuminata. Topotecan
          inhibits topoisomerase I activity by stabilizing the topoisomerase I-DNA
          covalent complexes during S phase of cell cycle, thereby inhibiting religation
          of topoisomerase I-mediated single-strand DNA breaks and producing potentially
          lethal double-strand DNA breaks when encountered by the DNA replication
          machinery.
        meaning: ncit:C1413
      Vincristine:

          Vincristine binds irreversibly to microtubules and spindle proteins in S
          phase of the cell cycle and interferes with the formation of the mitotic
          spindle, thereby arresting tumor cells in metaphase. This agent also depolymerizes
          microtubules and may also interfere with amino acid, cyclic AMP, and glutathione
          metabolism; calmodulin-dependent Ca++ -transport ATPase activity; cellular
          respiration; and nucleic acid and lipid biosynthesis. (NCI04)
        meaning: ncit:C933
      Vismodegib:
        description: An orally bioavailable, small molecule inhibitor of SMO and the
          Hedgehog (Hh) pathway, with potential antineoplastic activity. Upon oral
          administration, vismodegib targets, binds to and inhibits the cell membrane-spanning
          G-protein coupled receptor SMO, which may result in the suppression of Hh
          pathway signaling and a decrease in tumor cell proliferation and survival.
          SMO is activated upon binding of Hh ligand to the cell surface receptor
          Patched (PTCH); inappropriate activation of Hh signaling and uncontrolled
          cellular proliferation may be associated with SMO mutations.
        meaning: ncit:C74038
      Vorinostat:
        description: A synthetic hydroxamic acid derivative with antineoplastic activity.
          Vorinostat, a second generation polar-planar compound, binds to the catalytic
          domain of the histone deacetylases (HDACs). This allows the hydroxamic moiety
          to chelate zinc ion located in the catalytic pockets of HDAC, thereby inhibiting
          deacetylation and leading to an accumulation of both hyperacetylated histones
          and transcription factors. Hyperacetylation of histone proteins results
          in the upregulation of the cyclin-dependant kinase p21, followed by G1 arrest.
          Hyperacetylation of non-histone proteins such as tumor suppressor p53, alpha
          tubulin, and heat-shock protein 90 produces additional anti-proliferative
          effects. This agent also induces apoptosis and sensitizes tumor cells to
          cell death processes. Vorinostat crosses the blood-brain barrier.

          Plerixafor blocks the binding of stromal cell-derived factor (SDF-1alpha)
          to the cellular receptor CXCR4, resulting in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC)
          release from bone marrow and HSC movement into the peripheral circulation.
        meaning: ncit:C1777
      Amifostine:
        description: The trihydrate form of a phosphorylated aminosulfhydryl compound.
          After dephosphorylation of amifostine by alkaline phosphatase to an active
          free sulfhydryl (thiol) metabolite, the thiol metabolite binds to and detoxifies
          cytotoxic platinum-containing metabolites of cisplatin and scavenges free
          radicals induced by cisplatin and ionizing radiation. The elevated activity
          of this agent in normal tissues results from both the relative abundance
          of alkaline phosphatase in normal tissues and the greater vascularity of
          normal tissues compared to tumor tissues.
        meaning: ncit:C488
      Bleomycin:
        description: A mixture of glycopeptide antineoplastic antibiotics isolated
          from the bacterium Streptomyces verticillus. Bleomycin forms complexes with
          iron that reduce molecular oxygen to superoxide and hydroxyl radicals which
          cause single- and double-stranded breaks in DNA; these reactive oxygen species
          also induce lipid peroxidation, carbohydrate oxidation, and alterations
          in prostaglandin synthesis and degradation.
        meaning: ncit:C313
      Dactinomycin:
        description: A chromopeptide antineoplastic antibiotic isolated from the bacterium
          Streptomyces parvulus. Dactinomycin intercalates between adjacent guanine-cytosine
          base pairs, blocking the transcription of DNA by RNA polymerase; it also
          causes single-strand DNA breaks, possibly via a free-radical intermediate
          or an interaction with topoisomerase II. (NCI04)
        meaning: ncit:C412
      Etoposide Phosphate:

          Etoposide binds to the enzyme topoisomerase II, inducing double-strand DNA
          breaks, inhibiting DNA repair, and resulting in decreased DNA synthesis
          and tumor cell proliferation. Cells in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle
          are most sensitive to this agent. (NCI04)
        meaning: ncit:C1093
      Paclitaxel:
        description: A compound extracted from the Pacific yew tree Taxus brevifolia
          with antineoplastic activity. Paclitaxel binds to tubulin and inhibits the
          disassembly of microtubules, thereby resulting in the inhibition of cell
          division. This agent also induces apoptosis by binding to and blocking the
          function of the apoptosis inhibitor protein Bcl-2 (B-cell Leukemia 2). (NCI04)
        meaning: ncit:C1411
      Sodium Thiosulfate:
        description: A water soluble salt and reducing agent that reacts with oxidizing
          agents.  Although its exact mechanism of action is unknown, thiosulfate
          likely provides an exogenous source of sulfur, thereby hastening the detoxification
          of cyanide through the enzyme rhodanese (thiosulfate cyanide sulfurtransferase)
          which converts cyanide to the relatively nontoxic, excretable thiocyanate
          ion. In addition, this agent neutralizes the reactive alkylating species
          of nitrogen mustard, thereby decreasing skin toxicity related to nitrogen
          mustard extravasation. (NCI04)
        meaning: ncit:C1230
      Vinblastine:

          M phase of the cell cycle. This agent may also interfere with amino acid,
          cyclic AMP, and glutathione metabolism; calmodulin-dependent Ca++ -transport
          ATPase activity; cellular respiration; and nucleic acid and lipid biosynthesis.

          vedotin is generated by conjugating the chimeric anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody
          SGN-30 to the cytotoxic agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a valine-citrulline
          peptide linker. Upon administration and internalization by CD30-positive
          tumor cells, brentuximab vedotin undergoes enzymatic cleavage, releasing
          MMAE into the cytosol; MMAE binds to tubulin and inhibits tubulin polymerization,
          which may result in G2/M phase arrest and tumor cell apoptosis. Transiently
          activated during lymphocyte activation, CD30 (tumor necrosis factor receptor
          superfamily, member 8;TNFRSF8) may be constitutively expressed in hematologic
          malignancies including Hodgkin lymphoma and some T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas.
          The linkage system in brentuximab vedotin is highly stable in plasma, resulting

      Dexamethasone:
        description: A synthetic adrenal corticosteroid with potent anti-inflammatory
          properties. In addition to binding to specific nuclear steroid receptors,
          dexamethasone also interferes with NF-kB activation and apoptotic pathways.

          death-1 (PD-1, PCD-1) with immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic
          activities. Upon administration, nivolumab binds to and blocks the activation
          of PD-1, an immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) transmembrane protein, by
          its ligands programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), which is overexpressed
          on certain cancer cells, and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), which
          is primarily expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This results
          in the activation of T-cells and cell-mediated immune responses against
          tumor cells. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and plays
          a key role in tumor evasion from host immunity.

        description: A humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 antibody directed
          against human cell surface receptor PD-1 (programmed death-1 or programmed
          cell death-1) with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic
          activities. Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory
          signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks
          the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the
          activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The
          ligands for PD-1 include programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), overexpressed
          on certain cancer cells, and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), which
          is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell
          activation and plays a key role in in tumor evasion from host immunity.

      Prednisone:
        description: A synthetic glucocorticoid with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating
          properties. After cell surface receptor attachment and cell entry, prednisone
          enters the nucleus where it binds to and activates specific nuclear receptors,
          resulting in an altered gene expression and inhibition of proinflammatory
          cytokine production. This agent also decreases the number of circulating
          lymphocytes, induces cell differentiation, and stimulates apoptosis in sensitive
          tumor cell populations.
        meaning: ncit:C770
      Procarbazine:
        description: A methylhydrazine derivative with antineoplastic and mutagenic
          activities. Although the exact mode of cytotoxicity has not been elucidated,
          procarbazine, after metabolic activation, appears to inhibit the trans-methylation
          of methionine into transfer RNA (t-RNA), thereby preventing protein synthesis
          and consequently DNA and RNA synthesis. This agent may also undergo auto-oxidation,
          resulting in the formation of cytotoxic free radicals which damage DNA through
          an alkylation reaction.
        meaning: ncit:C62072

          which is chemically identical to or similar to an endogenous human granulocyte
          colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). Produced endogenously by monocytes, fibroblasts,
          and endothelial cells, G-CSF binds to and activates specific cell surface
          receptors, stimulating neutrophil progenitor proliferation and differentiation
          and selected neutrophil functions. Conjugation of the cytokine with a branched
          polyethylene glycol molecule (pegylation) significantly increases its therapeutic
          half-life. (NCI04)

      Thyroid Hormone Replacement:
        description: The sodium salt of levothyroxine, a synthetic levoisomer of thyroxine
          (T4) that is similar to the endogenous hormone produced by the thyroid gland.
          In peripheral tissues, levothyroxine is deiodinated by 5'-deiodinase to
          form triiodothyronine (T3). T3 enters the cell and binds to nuclear thyroid
          hormone receptors; the activated hormone-receptor complex in turn triggers
          gene expression and produces proteins required in the regulation of cellular
          respiration; thermogenesis; cellular growth and differentiation; and the
          metabolism of proteins, carbohydrates and lipids. T3 also exhibits cardiostimulatory
          effects.

      Cabozantinib:
        description: An orally bioavailable, small molecule receptor tyrosine kinase
          (RTK) inhibitor with potential antineoplastic activity. Cabozantinib strongly
          binds to and inhibits several RTKs, which are often overexpressed in a variety
          of cancer cell types, including hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET),
          RET (rearranged during transfection), vascular endothelial growth factor
          receptor types 1 (VEGFR-1), 2 (VEGFR-2), and 3 (VEGFR-3), mast/stem cell
          growth factor (KIT), FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT-3), TIE-2 (TEK tyrosine
          kinase, endothelial), tropomyosin-related kinase B (TRKB) and AXL. This
          may result in an inhibition of both tumor growth and angiogenesis, and eventually
          lead to tumor regression.
        meaning: ncit:C52200
      Denosumab:
        description: A fully human monoclonal antibody directed against the receptor
          activator of nuclear factor kappa beta ligand (RANKL) with antiosteoclast
          activity. Denosumab specifically binds to RANKL and blocks the interaction
          of RANKL with RANK, a receptor located on osteoclast cell surfaces, resulting
          in inhibition of osteoclast activity, a decrease in bone resorption, and
          a potential increase in bone mineral density. RANKL, a protein expressed
          by osteoblastic cells, plays an important role in osteoclastic differentiation
          and activation.

      Docetaxel:
        description: A semi-synthetic, second-generation taxane derived from a compound
          found in the European yew tree, Taxus baccata. Docetaxel displays potent
          and broad antineoplastic properties; it binds to and stabilizes tubulin,
          thereby inhibiting microtubule disassembly which results in cell- cycle
          arrest at the G2/M phase and cell death. This agent also inhibits pro-angiogenic
          factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and displays immunomodulatory
          and pro-inflammatory properties by inducing various mediators of the inflammatory
          response. Docetaxel has been studied for use as a radiation-sensitizing
          agent. (NCI04)
        meaning: ncit:C1526
      Glembatumumab:
        description: A human monoclonal antibody against transmembrane glycoprotein
          non-metastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB). Glembatumumab binds to GPNMB
          on cancer cells, but alone does not appear to inhibit cancer cell growth.
          However, this antibody could be utilized to deliver a conjugated cytotoxic
          agent to GPNMB-expressing tumor cells. GPNMB, overexpressed on the surface
          of various cancer cells, plays a key role in cancer cell proliferation.
        meaning: ncit:C84520
      Interferon:
        description: 'Human interferons have been classified into 3 groups: alpha,
          beta, and gamma. Both alpha- and beta-IFNs, previously designated type I,
          are acid-stable, but they differ immunologically and in regard to some biologic
          and physiochemical properties. The IFNs produced by virus-stimulated leukocytes
          (leukocyte IFNs) are predominantly of the alpha type. Those produced by
          lymphoblastoid cells are about 90% alpha and 10% beta. Induced fibroblasts
          produce mainly or exclusively the beta type. The alpha- and beta-IFNs differ
          widely in amino acid sequence. The gamma or immune IFNs, which are produced
          by T lymphocytes in response to mitogens or to antigens to which they are
          sensitized, are acid-labile and serologically distinct from alpha- and beta-IFNs.

      Mifamurtide:
        description: A liposomal formulation containing a muramyl dipeptide (MDP)
          analogue with potential immunomodulatory and antineoplastic activities.
          Muramyl tripeptide phosphatidylethanolamine (MTP-PE), a derivative of the
          mycobacterial cell wall component MDP, activates both monocytes and macrophages.
          Activated macrophages secrete cytokines and induce the recruitment and activation
          of other immune cells, which may result in indirect tumoricidal effects.
          Liposomal encapsulation of MTP-PE prolongs its half-life and enhances tissue
          targeting.
        meaning: ncit:C1394
      Regorafenib:
        description: The anhydrous form of regorafenib, an orally bioavailable small
          molecule with potential antiangiogenic and antineoplastic activities. Regorafenib
          binds to and inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs)
          2 and 3, and Ret, Kit, PDGFR and Raf kinases, which may result in the inhibition
          of tumor angiogenesis and tumor cell proliferation. VEGFRs are receptor
          tyrosine kinases that play important roles in tumor angiogenesis; the receptor
          tyrosine kinases RET, KIT, and PDGFR, and the serine/threonine-specific
          Raf kinase are involved in tumor cell signaling.
        meaning: ncit:C78204
      Zoledronic Acid:
        description: A synthetic imidazole bisphosphonate analog of pyrophosphate
          with anti-bone-resorption activity. A third-generation bisphosphonate, zoledronic
          acid binds to hydroxyapatite crystals in the bone matrix, slowing their
          dissolution and inhibiting the formation and aggregation of these crystals.
          This agent also inhibits farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, an enzyme involved
          in terpenoid biosynthesis. Inhibition of this enzyme prevents the biosynthesis
          of isoprenoid lipids, donor substrates of farnesylation and geranylgeranylation
          during the post-translational modification of small GTPase signalling proteins,
          which are important in the process of osteoclast turnover. Decreased bone
          turnover and stabilization of the bone matrix contribute to the analgesic
          effect of zoledronic acid with respect to painful osteoblastic tumors. The
          agent also reduces serum calcium concentrations associated with hypercalcemia.

          iron that reduce molecular oxygen to superoxide and hydroxyl radicals which
          cause single- and double-stranded breaks in DNA; these reactive oxygen species
          also induce lipid peroxidation, carbohydrate oxidation, and alterations
          in prostaglandin synthesis and degradation.

      Brentuximab Vedotin:
        description: An antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) directed against the tumor necrosis
          factor (TNF) receptor CD30 with potential antineoplastic activity. Brentuximab
          vedotin is generated by conjugating the chimeric anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody
          SGN-30 to the cytotoxic agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a valine-citrulline
          peptide linker. Upon administration and internalization by CD30-positive
          tumor cells, brentuximab vedotin undergoes enzymatic cleavage, releasing
          MMAE into the cytosol; MMAE binds to tubulin and inhibits tubulin polymerization,
          which may result in G2/M phase arrest and tumor cell apoptosis. Transiently
          activated during lymphocyte activation, CD30 (tumor necrosis factor receptor
          superfamily, member 8;TNFRSF8) may be constitutively expressed in hematologic
          malignancies including Hodgkin lymphoma and some T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas.

      Busulfan:
        description: A synthetic derivative of dimethane-sulfonate with antineoplastic
          and cytotoxic properties. Although its mechanism of action is not fully
          understood, busulfan appears to act through the alkylation of DNA. Following
          systemic absorption of busulfan, carbonium ions are formed, resulting in
          DNA alkylation and DNA breaks and inhibition of DNA replication and RNA
          transcription. (NCI04)
        meaning: ncit:C321
      Carboplatin:
        description: A second-generation platinum compound with a broad spectrum of
          antineoplastic properties. Carboplatin contains a platinum atom complexed
          with two ammonia groups and a cyclobutane-dicarboxyl residue. This agent
          is activated intracellularly to form reactive platinum complexes that bind
          to nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich sites in DNA, thereby inducing intrastrand
          and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as DNA-protein cross-links. These
          carboplatin-induced DNA and protein effects result in apoptosis and cell
          growth inhibition. This agent possesses tumoricidal activity similar to
          that of its parent compound, cisplatin, but is more stable and less toxic.

        meaning: ncit:C1282
      Carmustine:
        description: An antineoplastic nitrosourea. Carmustine alkylates and cross-links
          DNA during all phases of the cell cycle, resulting in disruption of DNA
          function, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. This agent also carbamoylates
          proteins, including DNA repair enzymes, resulting in an enhanced cytotoxic
          effect. Carmustine is highly lipophilic and crosses the blood-brain barrier
          readily. (NCI04)

      Cisplatin:
        description: An alkylating-like inorganic platinum agent (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum)
          with antineoplastic activity. Cisplatin forms highly reactive, charged,
          platinum complexes which bind to nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich sites
          in DNA inducing intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as
          DNA-protein cross-links. These cross-links result in apoptosis and cell
          growth inhibition.

      Cyclophosphamide:
        description: A synthetic alkylating agent chemically related to the nitrogen

          cyclophosphamide is converted to the active metabolites aldophosphamide
          and phosphoramide mustard, which bind to DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA replication
          and initiating cell death.

      Cytarabine:
        description: An antimetabolite analogue of cytidine with a modified sugar
          moiety (arabinose instead of ribose). Cytarabine is converted to the triphosphate
          form within the cell and then competes with cytidine for incorporation into
          DNA. Because the arabinose sugar sterically hinders the rotation of the
          molecule within DNA, DNA replication ceases, specifically during the S phase
          of the cell cycle. This agent also inhibits DNA polymerase, resulting in
          a decrease in DNA replication and repair. (NCI04)
        meaning: ncit:C408
      Dacarbazine:
        description: A triazene derivative with antineoplastic activity. Dacarbazine

          hormones. (NCI04)
        meaning: ncit:C422
      Doxorubicin:
        description: An anthracycline antibiotic with antineoplastic activity. Doxorubicin,
          isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius, is the
          hydroxylated congener of daunorubicin. Doxorubicin intercalates between
          base pairs in the DNA helix, thereby preventing DNA replication and ultimately
          inhibiting protein synthesis. Additionally, doxorubicin inhibits topoisomerase
          II which results in an increased and stabilized cleavable enzyme-DNA linked
          complex during DNA replication and subsequently prevents the ligation of
          the nucleotide strand after double-strand breakage. Doxorubicin also forms
          oxygen free radicals resulting in cytotoxicity secondary to lipid peroxidation
          of cell membrane lipids; the formation of oxygen free radicals also contributes
          to the toxicity of the anthracycline antibiotics, namely the cardiac and
          cutaneous vascular effects.

      Etoposide Phosphate:
        description: A phosphate salt of a semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin.
          Etoposide binds to the enzyme topoisomerase II, inducing double-strand DNA
          breaks, inhibiting DNA repair, and resulting in decreased DNA synthesis
          and tumor cell proliferation. Cells in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle
          are most sensitive to this agent. (NCI04)
        meaning: ncit:C1093
      Etoposide:
        description: A semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin, a substance extracted
          from the mandrake root Podophyllum peltatum. Possessing potent antineoplastic
          properties, etoposide binds to and inhibits topoisomerase II and its function
          in ligating cleaved DNA molecules, resulting in the accumulation of single-
          or double-strand DNA breaks, the inhibition of DNA replication and transcription,
          and apoptotic cell death. Etoposide acts primarily in the G2 and S phases
          of the cell cycle. (NCI04)
        meaning: ncit:C491
      Fludarabine:
        description: A fluorinated nucleotide antimetabolite analog of the antiviral
          agent vidarabine (ara-A) with antineoplastic activity. Administered parenterally
          as a phosphate salt, fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to
          2-fluoro-ara-A and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine
          kinase to the active triphosphate, 2-fluoro-ara-ATP. This metabolite may
          inhibit DNA polymerase alpha, ribonucleotide reductase and DNA primase,
          thereby interrupting DNA synthesis and inhibiting tumor cell growth. (NCI04)
        meaning: ncit:C1094
      Gemcitabine:
        description: A broad-spectrum antimetabolite and deoxycytidine analogue with
          antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, gemcitabine is converted into
          the active metabolites difluorodeoxycytidine diphosphate (dFdCDP) and difluorodeoxycytidine
          triphosphate (dFdCTP) by deoxycytidine kinase. dFdCTP competes with deoxycytidine
          triphosphate (dCTP) and is incorporated into DNA. This locks DNA polymerase
          thereby resulting in "masked termination" during DNA replication. On the
          other hand, dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, thereby decreasing
          the deoxynucleotide pool available for DNA synthesis. The reduction in the
          intracellular concentration of dCTP potentiates the incorporation of dFdCTP
          into DNA.
        meaning: ncit:C66876
      Ifosfamide:
        description: A synthetic analogue of the nitrogen mustard cyclophosphamide

          enzymes. (NCI04)
        meaning: ncit:C564
      Melphalan:
        description: A phenylalanine derivative of nitrogen mustard with antineoplastic

          dihydrofolate reductase, resulting in inhibition of purine nucleotide and
          thymidylate synthesis and, subsequently, inhibition of DNA and RNA syntheses.
          Methotrexate also exhibits potent immunosuppressant activity although the
          mechanism(s) of actions is unclear.
        meaning: ncit:C642
      Nitrogen Mustard:
        description: A synthetic agent related to sulphur mustard with antineoplastic
          and immunosuppressive properties. Nitrogen mustard (a member of a family
          of chemotherapy agents including cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil) is an
          irritant and carcinogenic agent metabolized to a highly reactive ethylene
          immonium derivative; the ethylene immonium derivative alkylates DNA and
          inhibits DNA replication. This agent also exhibits lympholytic properties.

          activities. Upon administration, nivolumab binds to and blocks the activation
          of PD-1, an immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) transmembrane protein, by
          its ligands programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), which is overexpressed
          on certain cancer cells, and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), which
          is primarily expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This results
          in the activation of T-cells and cell-mediated immune responses against
          tumor cells. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and plays
          a key role in tumor evasion from host immunity.

      Pembrolizumab:
        description: A humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 antibody directed
          against human cell surface receptor PD-1 (programmed death-1 or programmed
          cell death-1) with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic
          activities. Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory
          signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks
          the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the
          activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The
          ligands for PD-1 include programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), overexpressed
          on certain cancer cells, and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), which
          is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell

      Prednisone:
        description: A synthetic glucocorticoid with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating
          properties. After cell surface receptor attachment and cell entry, prednisone
          enters the nucleus where it binds to and activates specific nuclear receptors,
          resulting in an altered gene expression and inhibition of proinflammatory
          cytokine production. This agent also decreases the number of circulating
          lymphocytes, induces cell differentiation, and stimulates apoptosis in sensitive
          tumor cell populations.
        meaning: ncit:C770
      Procarbazine:
        description: A methylhydrazine derivative with antineoplastic and mutagenic

          procarbazine, after metabolic activation, appears to inhibit the trans-methylation
          of methionine into transfer RNA (t-RNA), thereby preventing protein synthesis
          and consequently DNA and RNA synthesis. This agent may also undergo auto-oxidation,
          resulting in the formation of cytotoxic free radicals which damage DNA through
          an alkylation reaction.

          activity. Upon administration, thiotepa is converted into highly reactive
          ethylenimine groups, which covalently bind to nucleophilic groups in DNA
          and demonstrate a preference for the N7 position of guanine bases. This
          induces crosslinking of alkylated guanine bases in double-stranded DNA,
          interferes with both DNA replication and cell division, and results in both
          the induction of apoptosis and the inhibition of cell growth.

          complete failure of atrial electrical impulse conduction to the ventricles.
          This is manifested on the ECG by disassociation of atrial and ventricular
          rhythms. The atrial rate must be faster than the ventricular rate. (CDISC)
        meaning: ncit:C50501
      Prolonged QT:
        description: An electrocardiographic finding in which the QT interval not
          corrected for heart rate is prolonged. Thresholds for different age, gender,
          and patient populations exist.
        meaning: ncit:C71034
      Supraventricular Tachycardia:
        description: A disorder characterized by an electrocardiographic finding of
          a tachycardia which does not originate in the ventricles or His Purkinje
          system. There is an abnormally high heart rate and QRS complexes are typically
          narrow, but aberration or preexcitation may be present.
        meaning: ncit:C35061
      Cardiomyopathy, NOS:
        description: 'A disease of the heart muscle or myocardium proper. Cardiomyopathies
          may be classified as either primary or secondary, on the basis of etiology,
          or on the pathophysiology of the lesion: hypertrophic, dilated, or restrictive.'
        meaning: ncit:C34830
      Restrictive Cardiomyopathy:
        description: A type of heart disorder referring to the inability of the ventricles
          to fill with blood because the myocardium (heart muscle) stiffens and looses
          its flexibility. Causes include replacement of the myocardium with scar
          tissue, abnormal cellular infiltration of the myocardium, or deposition
          of a substance (e.g., amyloid) in the myocardium.
        meaning: ncit:C62798
      Dilated Cardiomyopathy:
        description: Cardiomyopathy which is characterized by dilation and contractile
          dysfunction of the left and right ventricles. It may be idiopathic, or it
          may result from a myocardial infarction, myocardial infection, or alcohol
          abuse. It is a cause of congestive heart failure.
        meaning: ncit:C84673
      Sensory Neuropathy:
        description: Inflammation or degeneration of the sensory nerves.
        meaning: ncit:C3501
      Motor Neuropathy:
        description: Inflammation or degeneration of the peripheral motor nerves.
        meaning: ncit:C3500
      Pulmonary Fibrosis:
        description: Chronic progressive interstitial lung disorder characterized
          by the replacement of the lung tissue by connective tissue, leading to progressive
          dyspnea, respiratory failure, or right heart failure. Causes include chronic
          inflammatory processes, exposure to environmental irritants, radiation therapy,
          autoimmune disorders, certain drugs, or it may be idiopathic (no identifiable
          cause).
        meaning: ncit:C26869
      Asthma:
        description: A chronic respiratory disease manifested as difficulty breathing
          due to the narrowing of bronchial passageways.
        meaning: ncit:C28397
      Decreased Creatinine Clearance:
        description: A laboratory test finding that indicates decreased creatinine
          clearance.
        meaning: ncit:C185671
      Tubular Damage:
        description: Damage to the renal tubules.
        meaning: ncit:C185689
      AKI:
        description: Sudden and sustained deterioration of the kidney function characterized
          by decreased glomerular filtration rate, increased serum creatinine or oliguria.
        meaning: ncit:C26808
      Decreased GFR:
        description: A laboratory test result which indicates a decreased glomerular
          filtration rate.
        meaning: ncit:C78326
      AIN:
        description: A condition characterized by the autoantibody-induced destruction
          of neutrophils.
