          with antineoplastic activity. Doxorubicin, isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces
          peucetius var. caesius, is the hydroxylated congener of daunorubicin. Doxorubicin
          intercalates between base pairs in the DNA helix, thereby preventing DNA
          replication and ultimately inhibiting protein synthesis. Additionally, doxorubicin
          inhibits topoisomerase II which results in an increased and stabilized cleavable
          enzyme-DNA linked complex during DNA replication and subsequently prevents
          the ligation of the nucleotide strand after double-strand breakage. Doxorubicin
          also forms oxygen free radicals resulting in cytotoxicity secondary to lipid
          peroxidation of cell membrane lipids; the formation of oxygen free radicals
          also contributes to the toxicity of the anthracycline antibiotics, namely
          the cardiac and cutaneous vascular effects.
