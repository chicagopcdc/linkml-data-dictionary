      DOX:
        description: The hydrochloride salt of doxorubicin, an anthracycline antibiotic
          with antineoplastic activity. Doxorubicin, isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces
          peucetius var. caesius, is the hydroxylated congener of daunorubicin. Doxorubicin
          intercalates between base pairs in the DNA helix, thereby preventing DNA
          replication and ultimately inhibiting protein synthesis. Additionally, doxorubicin
          inhibits topoisomerase II which results in an increased and stabilized cleavable
          enzyme-DNA linked complex during DNA replication and subsequently prevents
          the ligation of the nucleotide strand after double-strand breakage. Doxorubicin
          also forms oxygen free radicals resulting in cytotoxicity secondary to lipid
          peroxidation of cell membrane lipids; the formation of oxygen free radicals
          also contributes to the toxicity of the anthracycline antibiotics, namely
          the cardiac and cutaneous vascular effects.

        description: A technique for measuring the gamma radiation produced by collisions
          of electrons and positrons (anti-electrons) within living tissue. In positron
          emission tomography (PET), a subject is given a dose of a positron-emitting
          radionuclide attached to a metabolically active substance (for example,
          2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), which is similar to a naturally occurring

          breaks, arrest of the S/G2 phase of the cell cycle, and cell death. This
          agent's cytotoxicity is maximal during the S phase of the cell cycle when
          topoisomerase levels are greatest. In addition, amsacrine may induce transcription
          of tumor promoter p53 protein and block p53 ubiquitination and proteasomal

          This agent causes damage to or degradation of the promyelocytic leukemia
          protein/retinoic acid receptor-alpha (PML/RARa) fusion protein; induces
          apoptosis in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells and in many other

          iron that reduce molecular oxygen to superoxide and hydroxyl radicals which
          cause single- and double-stranded breaks in DNA; these reactive oxygen species
          also induce lipid peroxidation, carbohydrate oxidation, and alterations

        meaning: ncit:C313
      Bortezomib:
        description: A dipeptide boronic acid analogue with antineoplastic activity.
          Bortezomib reversibly inhibits the 26S proteasome, a large protease complex
          that degrades ubiquinated proteins. By blocking the targeted proteolysis
          normally performed by the proteasome, bortezomib disrupts various cell signaling
          pathways, leading to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and inhibition of angiogenesis.
          Specifically, the agent inhibits nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, a protein that
          is constitutively activated in some cancers, thereby interfering with NF-kappaB-mediated
          cell survival, tumor growth, and angiogenesis. In vivo, bortezomib delays
          tumor growth and enhances the cytotoxic effects of radiation and chemotherapy.
        meaning: ncit:C1851
      Brentuximab Vedotin:
        description: An antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) directed against the tumor necrosis
          factor (TNF) receptor CD30 with potential antineoplastic activity. Brentuximab
          vedotin is generated by conjugating the chimeric anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody
          SGN-30 to the cytotoxic agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a valine-citrulline
          peptide linker. Upon administration and internalization by CD30-positive
          tumor cells, brentuximab vedotin undergoes enzymatic cleavage, releasing
          MMAE into the cytosol; MMAE binds to tubulin and inhibits tubulin polymerization,
          which may result in G2/M phase arrest and tumor cell apoptosis. Transiently
          activated during lymphocyte activation, CD30 (tumor necrosis factor receptor
          superfamily, member 8;TNFRSF8) may be constitutively expressed in hematologic
          malignancies including Hodgkin lymphoma and some T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas.
          The linkage system in brentuximab vedotin is highly stable in plasma, resulting
          in cytotoxic specificity for CD30-positive cells.
        meaning: ncit:C66944
      Busulfan:
        description: A synthetic derivative of dimethane-sulfonate with antineoplastic

          understood, busulfan appears to act through the alkylation of DNA. Following
          systemic absorption of busulfan, carbonium ions are formed, resulting in
          DNA alkylation and DNA breaks and inhibition of DNA replication and RNA
          transcription. (NCI04)

          is activated intracellularly to form reactive platinum complexes that bind
          to nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich sites in DNA, thereby inducing intrastrand
          and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as DNA-protein cross-links. These
          carboplatin-induced DNA and protein effects result in apoptosis and cell
          growth inhibition. This agent possesses tumoricidal activity similar to
          that of its parent compound, cisplatin, but is more stable and less toxic.

        meaning: ncit:C412
      Daunorubicin:
        description: An anthracycline antineoplastic antibiotic with therapeutic effects
          similar to those of doxorubicin. Daunorubicin exhibits cytotoxic activity

      Daunorubicin (Liposomal):
        description: A liposome-encapsulated form of the citrate salt of the anthracycline
          antineoplastic antibiotic daunorubicin. Daunorubicin intercalates into DNA
          and interacts with topoisomerase II, thereby inhibiting DNA replication
          and repair and RNA and protein synthesis. Liposomal delivery of doxorubicin
          citrate improves drug penetration into tumors and decreases drug clearance,
          thereby increasing the duration of therapeutic drug effects.

      Daunorubicin and Cytarabine (Liposomal):
        description: A liposomal formulation containing a fixed combination of the
          antineoplastic agents cytarabine and daunorubicin in a 5:1 molar ratio.
          Liposome-encapsulated daunorubicin-cytarabine has been designed to provide
          optimal delivery of a specific ratio of cytarabine to daunorubicin, one
          that has been shown to be synergistic in vitro. The antimetabolite cytarabine
          competes with cytidine for incorporation into DNA, inhibiting DNA synthesis.
          This agent also inhibits DNA polymerase, resulting in a decrease in DNA
          replication and repair. Daunorubicin, an intercalator and a topoisomerase
          II inhibitor, prevents DNA replication and inhibits protein synthesis. This
          agent also generates oxygen free radicals, resulting in the cytotoxic lipid
          peroxidation of cell membrane lipids.

          arrest at the G2/M phase and cell death. This agent also inhibits pro-angiogenic
          factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and displays immunomodulatory
          and pro-inflammatory properties by inducing various mediators of the inflammatory
          response. Docetaxel has been studied for use as a radiation-sensitizing
          agent. (NCI04)

      Gemcitabine:
        description: A broad-spectrum antimetabolite and deoxycytidine analogue with
          antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, gemcitabine is converted into
          the active metabolites difluorodeoxycytidine diphosphate (dFdCDP) and difluorodeoxycytidine
          triphosphate (dFdCTP) by deoxycytidine kinase. dFdCTP competes with deoxycytidine
          triphosphate (dCTP) and is incorporated into DNA. This locks DNA polymerase
          thereby resulting in "masked termination" during DNA replication. On the
          other hand, dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, thereby decreasing
          the deoxynucleotide pool available for DNA synthesis. The reduction in the
          intracellular concentration of dCTP potentiates the incorporation of dFdCTP
          into DNA.

          activity. Gilteritinib binds to and inhibits both the wild-type and mutated
          forms of FLT3, AXL and ALK. This may result in an inhibition of FLT3, AXL,
          and ALK-mediated signal transduction pathways and reduces tumor cell proliferation
          in cancer cell types that overexpress these RTKs. FLT3, AXL and ALK, overexpressed
          or mutated in a variety of cancer cell types, play a key role in tumor cell

          non-metastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB). Glembatumumab binds to GPNMB
          on cancer cells, but alone does not appear to inhibit cancer cell growth.
          However, this antibody could be utilized to deliver a conjugated cytotoxic
          agent to GPNMB-expressing tumor cells. GPNMB, overexpressed on the surface
          of various cancer cells, plays a key role in cancer cell proliferation.

          hormone that stimulates anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities,
          in addition to exhibiting minor mineralocorticoid effects. This agent binds
          to intracellular glucocorticoid receptors and is translocated into the nucleus,
          where it initiates the transcription of glucocorticoid-responsive genes,
          such as various cytokines and lipocortins. Lipocortins inhibit phospholipase
          A2, thereby blocking the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids
          and preventing the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, both potent
          mediators of inflammation.

          are acid-stable, but they differ immunologically and in regard to some biologic
          and physiochemical properties. The IFNs produced by virus-stimulated leukocytes
          (leukocyte IFNs) are predominantly of the alpha type. Those produced by
          lymphoblastoid cells are about 90% alpha and 10% beta. Induced fibroblasts
          produce mainly or exclusively the beta type. The alpha- and beta-IFNs differ
          widely in amino acid sequence. The gamma or immune IFNs, which are produced
          by T lymphocytes in response to mitogens or to antigens to which they are
          sensitized, are acid-labile and serologically distinct from alpha- and beta-IFNs.

          of PD-1, an immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) transmembrane protein, by
          its ligands programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), which is overexpressed
          on certain cancer cells, and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), which
          is primarily expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This results
          in the activation of T-cells and cell-mediated immune responses against

          activities. Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory
          signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks
          the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the
          activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The
          ligands for PD-1 include programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), overexpressed
          on certain cancer cells, and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), which
          is primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell

        description: A synthetic imidazole bisphosphonate analog of pyrophosphate
          with anti-bone-resorption activity. A third-generation bisphosphonate, zoledronic
          acid binds to hydroxyapatite crystals in the bone matrix, slowing their
          dissolution and inhibiting the formation and aggregation of these crystals.
          This agent also inhibits farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, an enzyme involved
          in terpenoid biosynthesis. Inhibition of this enzyme prevents the biosynthesis
          of isoprenoid lipids, donor substrates of farnesylation and geranylgeranylation
          during the post-translational modification of small GTPase signalling proteins,
          which are important in the process of osteoclast turnover. Decreased bone
          turnover and stabilization of the bone matrix contribute to the analgesic
          effect of zoledronic acid with respect to painful osteoblastic lesions.
          The agent also reduces serum calcium concentrations associated with hypercalcemia.

          disorders, following partial or complete bone marrow ablation, or following
          high dose chemotherapy or radiation treatment for cancer. Immature circulating
          blood cells, similar to stem cells in the bone marrow, are removed before
          treatment. The cells are then given to the patient after treatment to help
          the bone marrow recover and continue producing healthy blood cells. Transplantation
          may be autologous (the patient's own blood cells are used), allogeneic (blood
          cells are donated by someone else), or syngeneic (blood cells are donated
          by an identical twin).

    Brentuximab Vedotin:
      description: An antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) directed against the tumor necrosis

        vedotin is generated by conjugating the chimeric anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody
        SGN-30 to the cytotoxic agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a valine-citrulline
        peptide linker. Upon administration and internalization by CD30-positive tumor
        cells, brentuximab vedotin undergoes enzymatic cleavage, releasing MMAE into
        the cytosol; MMAE binds to tubulin and inhibits tubulin polymerization, which
        may result in G2/M phase arrest and tumor cell apoptosis. Transiently activated
        during lymphocyte activation, CD30 (tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily,
        member 8;TNFRSF8) may be constitutively expressed in hematologic malignancies
        including Hodgkin lymphoma and some T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas. The linkage

        activated intracellularly to form reactive platinum complexes that bind to
        nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich sites in DNA, thereby inducing intrastrand
        and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as DNA-protein cross-links. These
        carboplatin-induced DNA and protein effects result in apoptosis and cell growth
        inhibition. This agent possesses tumoricidal activity similar to that of its
        parent compound, cisplatin, but is more stable and less toxic. (NCI04)
      meaning: ncit:C1282
    Carmustine:
      description: An antineoplastic nitrosourea. Carmustine alkylates and cross-links
        DNA during all phases of the cell cycle, resulting in disruption of DNA function,
        cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. This agent also carbamoylates proteins,
        including DNA repair enzymes, resulting in an enhanced cytotoxic effect. Carmustine
        is highly lipophilic and crosses the blood-brain barrier readily. (NCI04)
      meaning: ncit:C349
    Cisplatin:
      description: An alkylating-like inorganic platinum agent (cis-diamminedichloroplatinum)
        with antineoplastic activity. Cisplatin forms highly reactive, charged, platinum
        complexes which bind to nucleophilic groups such as GC-rich sites in DNA inducing
        intrastrand and interstrand DNA cross-links, as well as DNA-protein cross-links.
        These cross-links result in apoptosis and cell growth inhibition.
      meaning: ncit:C376
    Cyclophosphamide:
      description: A synthetic alkylating agent chemically related to the nitrogen
        mustards with antineoplastic and immunosuppressive activities. In the liver,
        cyclophosphamide is converted to the active metabolites aldophosphamide and
        phosphoramide mustard, which bind to DNA, thereby inhibiting DNA replication
        and initiating cell death.
      meaning: ncit:C405
    Cytarabine:
      description: An antimetabolite analogue of cytidine with a modified sugar moiety
        (arabinose instead of ribose). Cytarabine is converted to the triphosphate
        form within the cell and then competes with cytidine for incorporation into
        DNA. Because the arabinose sugar sterically hinders the rotation of the molecule
        within DNA, DNA replication ceases, specifically during the S phase of the
        cell cycle. This agent also inhibits DNA polymerase, resulting in a decrease
        in DNA replication and repair. (NCI04)
      meaning: ncit:C408
    Dacarbazine:
      description: A triazene derivative with antineoplastic activity. Dacarbazine
        alkylates and cross-links DNA during all phases of the cell cycle, resulting
        in disruption of DNA function, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. (NCI04)
      meaning: ncit:C411
    Dexamethasone:
      description: A synthetic adrenal corticosteroid with potent anti-inflammatory
        properties. In addition to binding to specific nuclear steroid receptors,
        dexamethasone also interferes with NF-kB activation and apoptotic pathways.
        This agent lacks the salt-retaining properties of other related adrenal hormones.
        (NCI04)
      meaning: ncit:C422
    Doxorubicin:
      description: An anthracycline antibiotic with antineoplastic activity. Doxorubicin,
        isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius, is the hydroxylated
        congener of daunorubicin. Doxorubicin intercalates between base pairs in the
        DNA helix, thereby preventing DNA replication and ultimately inhibiting protein
        synthesis. Additionally, doxorubicin inhibits topoisomerase II which results
        in an increased and stabilized cleavable enzyme-DNA linked complex during
        DNA replication and subsequently prevents the ligation of the nucleotide strand
        after double-strand breakage. Doxorubicin also forms oxygen free radicals
        resulting in cytotoxicity secondary to lipid peroxidation of cell membrane
        lipids; the formation of oxygen free radicals also contributes to the toxicity
        of the anthracycline antibiotics, namely the cardiac and cutaneous vascular
        effects.
      meaning: ncit:C456
    Etoposide Phosphate:
      description: A phosphate salt of a semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin.
        Etoposide binds to the enzyme topoisomerase II, inducing double-strand DNA
        breaks, inhibiting DNA repair, and resulting in decreased DNA synthesis and
        tumor cell proliferation. Cells in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle are
        most sensitive to this agent. (NCI04)
      meaning: ncit:C1093
    Etoposide:
      description: A semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin, a substance extracted
        from the mandrake root Podophyllum peltatum. Possessing potent antineoplastic
        properties, etoposide binds to and inhibits topoisomerase II and its function
        in ligating cleaved DNA molecules, resulting in the accumulation of single-
        or double-strand DNA breaks, the inhibition of DNA replication and transcription,
        and apoptotic cell death. Etoposide acts primarily in the G2 and S phases
        of the cell cycle. (NCI04)
      meaning: ncit:C491
    Fludarabine:
      description: A fluorinated nucleotide antimetabolite analog of the antiviral
        agent vidarabine (ara-A) with antineoplastic activity. Administered parenterally
        as a phosphate salt, fludarabine phosphate is rapidly dephosphorylated to
        2-fluoro-ara-A and then phosphorylated intracellularly by deoxycytidine kinase
        to the active triphosphate, 2-fluoro-ara-ATP. This metabolite may inhibit
        DNA polymerase alpha, ribonucleotide reductase and DNA primase, thereby interrupting
        DNA synthesis and inhibiting tumor cell growth. (NCI04)
      meaning: ncit:C1094
    Gemcitabine:
      description: A broad-spectrum antimetabolite and deoxycytidine analogue with
        antineoplastic activity. Upon administration, gemcitabine is converted into
        the active metabolites difluorodeoxycytidine diphosphate (dFdCDP) and difluorodeoxycytidine
        triphosphate (dFdCTP) by deoxycytidine kinase. dFdCTP competes with deoxycytidine
        triphosphate (dCTP) and is incorporated into DNA. This locks DNA polymerase
        thereby resulting in "masked termination" during DNA replication. On the other
        hand, dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, thereby decreasing the deoxynucleotide
        pool available for DNA synthesis. The reduction in the intracellular concentration
        of dCTP potentiates the incorporation of dFdCTP into DNA.
      meaning: ncit:C66876
    Ifosfamide:
      description: A synthetic analogue of the nitrogen mustard cyclophosphamide with
        antineoplastic activity. Ifosfamide alkylates and forms DNA crosslinks, thereby
        preventing DNA strand separation and DNA replication. This agent is a prodrug
        that must be activated through hydroxylation by hepatic microsomal enzymes.
        (NCI04)
      meaning: ncit:C564
    Melphalan:
      description: A phenylalanine derivative of nitrogen mustard with antineoplastic
        activity. Melphalan alkylates DNA at the N7 position of guanine and induces
        DNA inter-strand cross-linkages, resulting in the inhibition of DNA and RNA
        synthesis and cytotoxicity against both dividing and non-dividing tumor cells.
      meaning: ncit:C633
    Methotrexate:
      description: An antimetabolite and antifolate agent with antineoplastic and
        immunosuppressant activities. Methotrexate binds to and inhibits the enzyme
        dihydrofolate reductase, resulting in inhibition of purine nucleotide and
        thymidylate synthesis and, subsequently, inhibition of DNA and RNA syntheses.
        Methotrexate also exhibits potent immunosuppressant activity although the
        mechanism(s) of actions is unclear.
      meaning: ncit:C642
    Nitrogen Mustard:
      description: A synthetic agent related to sulphur mustard with antineoplastic
        and immunosuppressive properties. Nitrogen mustard (a member of a family of
        chemotherapy agents including cyclophosphamide and chlorambucil) is an irritant
        and carcinogenic agent metabolized to a highly reactive ethylene immonium
        derivative; the ethylene immonium derivative alkylates DNA and inhibits DNA
        replication. This agent also exhibits lympholytic properties. (NCI04)
      meaning: ncit:C62056
    Nivolumab:
      description: A fully human immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 monoclonal antibody directed
        against the negative immunoregulatory human cell surface receptor programmed
        death-1 (PD-1, PCD-1) with immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic
        activities. Upon administration, nivolumab binds to and blocks the activation
        of PD-1, an immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) transmembrane protein, by its
        ligands programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), which is overexpressed on
        certain cancer cells, and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), which is
        primarily expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). This results in the
        activation of T-cells and cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells.
        Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation and plays a key role
        in tumor evasion from host immunity.
      meaning: ncit:C68814
    Pembrolizumab:
      description: A humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G4 antibody directed
        against human cell surface receptor PD-1 (programmed death-1 or programmed
        cell death-1) with potential immune checkpoint inhibitory and antineoplastic
        activities. Upon administration, pembrolizumab binds to PD-1, an inhibitory
        signaling receptor expressed on the surface of activated T cells, and blocks
        the binding to and activation of PD-1 by its ligands, which results in the
        activation of T-cell-mediated immune responses against tumor cells. The ligands
        for PD-1 include programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), overexpressed on
        certain cancer cells, and programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2), which is
        primarily expressed on APCs. Activated PD-1 negatively regulates T-cell activation
        and plays a key role in in tumor evasion from host immunity.
      meaning: ncit:C106432
    Prednisone:
      description: A synthetic glucocorticoid with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulating
        properties. After cell surface receptor attachment and cell entry, prednisone
        enters the nucleus where it binds to and activates specific nuclear receptors,
        resulting in an altered gene expression and inhibition of proinflammatory
        cytokine production. This agent also decreases the number of circulating lymphocytes,
        induces cell differentiation, and stimulates apoptosis in sensitive tumor
        cell populations.
      meaning: ncit:C770
    Procarbazine:
      description: A methylhydrazine derivative with antineoplastic and mutagenic
        activities. Although the exact mode of cytotoxicity has not been elucidated,
        procarbazine, after metabolic activation, appears to inhibit the trans-methylation
        of methionine into transfer RNA (t-RNA), thereby preventing protein synthesis
        and consequently DNA and RNA synthesis. This agent may also undergo auto-oxidation,
        resulting in the formation of cytotoxic free radicals which damage DNA through
        an alkylation reaction.
      meaning: ncit:C62072
    Thiotepa:
      description: A polyfunctional, organophosphorus alkylating agent and a stable
        derivative of N,N',N''-triethylenephosphoramide (TEPA), with antineoplastic
        activity. Upon administration, thiotepa is converted into highly reactive
        ethylenimine groups, which covalently bind to nucleophilic groups in DNA and
        demonstrate a preference for the N7 position of guanine bases. This induces
        crosslinking of alkylated guanine bases in double-stranded DNA, interferes
        with both DNA replication and cell division, and results in both the induction
        of apoptosis and the inhibition of cell growth.
      meaning: ncit:C875
    Vinorelbine:
      description: A semisynthetic vinca alkaloid. Vinorelbine binds to tubulin and

      description: A natural alkaloid isolated from the plant Vinca rosea Linn. Vincristine
        binds irreversibly to microtubules and spindle proteins in S phase of the
        cell cycle and interferes with the formation of the mitotic spindle, thereby
        arresting tumor cells in metaphase. This agent also depolymerizes microtubules
        and may also interfere with amino acid, cyclic AMP, and glutathione metabolism;
        calmodulin-dependent Ca++ -transport ATPase activity; cellular respiration;
        and nucleic acid and lipid biosynthesis. (NCI04)
