    range: RaceEnum
    description: 'A group of people who share physical characteristics, such as skin
      color and facial features. They may also share similar social or cultural identities
      and ancestral backgrounds. There are many racial groups, and a person may belong
      to or identify with more than one group. Some diseases, such as cancer, may
      be more common in certain races than in others. (Source: NCI Dictionary of Cancer
      Terms)'

  ethnicity:
    range: EthnicityEnum
    description: 'The social and cultural characteristics, backgrounds, or experiences
      shared by a group of people. These include language, religion, beliefs, values,
      and behaviors that are often handed down from one generation to the next. Some

      groups than in others. (Source: NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms)'

    description: What kind of relation is this relative who has had a relevant medical
      condition?
  prior_cancer_type:
    description: The type of prior cancer from the medical history of the relative
      of the subject.
  honest_broker_subject_id:
    description: 'The identifier assigned to the subject by the honest broker--an
      individual, organization or system acting for, or on behalf of, a covered entity
      to collect and provide health information to research investigators in such
      a manner whereby it would not be reasonably possible for the investigators or
      others to identify the corresponding patients-subjects directly or indirectly.
      The honest broker cannot be one of the investigators. The information provided
      to the investigators by the honest broker may incorporate linkage codes to permit
      information collation and/or subsequent inquiries (i.e., a "re-identification
      code"), however the information linking this re-identification code to the patient''s
      identity must be retained by the honest broker and subsequent inquiries are
      conducted through the honest broker. (Source: NCI Thersaurus)'
  consortium:
    range: ConsortiumEnum
    description: The disease consortium to which the data contributor belongs.
  data_contributor_id:
    range: DataContributorIdEnum
    description: An identifier assigned to a data contributor.
  study_id:
    range: StudyIdEnum
    description: A sequence of characters used to identify, name, or characterize
      the study.
  age_at_enrollment:
    range: integer
    description: Age of subject (in days) when the subject enrolled in the study.
  year_at_enrollment:
    range: integer
    description: The year at which a subject enrolled in a study.
  treatment_arm:
    range: TreatmentArmEnum
    description: A specific treatment plan within a clinical trial that describes
      the activities a subject will be involved in as he or she progresses through
      the study.
  enrolled_status:
    range: EnrolledStatusEnum
    description: This variable indicates if the subject was enrolled in the study,
      or if the subject was not enrolled in the study but received treatment per the
      study's protocol.
  efs_censor_status:
    range: EfsCensorStatusEnum
    description: The event free survival censor status
  age_at_censor_status:
    range: integer
    description: Age (in days) of the subject at the time of the CENSOR_STATUS
  data_source:
    range: DataSourceEnum
    description: Is this data coming from a cancer registry or via a clinical study?
  randomized_status:
    range: RandomizedStatusEnum
    description: The allocation of individuals to groups by chance, especially in
      order to control the variables in an experiment.
  study_phase:

      for the collection of this data.

  disease_phase:
    range: DiseasePhaseEnum
    description: The phase of the cancer treatment process during which relevant observations
      were recorded. This variable is used across domains to frame the timing of these
      longitudinal observations and reduce the number of redundant variables needed
      to report similar concepts (see "Disease Phase Timing and Course Table" in the
      documentation for additional guidance).
  disease_phase_number:
    range: integer
    description: This variable indicates the ordinal numbering of the Disease Phase
      variable within its various subgroups (e.g., Relapse 1, Relapse 2, Relapse 3,
      etc.). The observations across domains can therefore be organized longitudinally
      without the need for specific dates.
  age_at_disease_phase:
    range: integer
    description: The age (in days) of the subject at the time that this ordinally
      numbered disease phase was recorded.
  year_at_disease_phase:
    range: integer
    description: The year in which this ordinally numbered disease phase was recorded.
  course:
    range: CourseEnum
    description: The protocol treatment "course" during which relevant observations
      were recorded. This variable is used across domains to frame the timing of these
      longitudinal observations and reduce the number of redundant variables needed
      to report similar concepts (see "Disease Phase Timing and Course Table" in the
      documentation for additional guidance).
  course_number:
    range: integer
    description: This variable indicates the ordinal numbering of the Course variable
      within its various subgroups (e.g., Induction 1, Induction 2, Induction 3, etc.).
      The observations across domains can therefore be organized longitudinally without
      the need for specific dates.
  age_at_course_start:
    range: integer
    description: The age (in days) of the subject at the time that this ordinally
      numbered course was started.
  age_at_course_end:
    range: integer
    description: The age (in days) of the subject at the time that this ordinally
      numbered course was completed.
  age_at_txassign:
    range: integer
    description: The age (in days) of the subject at the time that this treartment
      was assigned.
  age_at_course_anc_500:
    range: integer
    description: The age (in days) of the subject when the subject's neutrophil count
      exceeded 500 (ANC/mm3)
  cycle_number:
    range: integer
    description: This variable indicates the ordinal numbering of cycles of treatment
      therapy administered to the subject.

      cycle.
