A standard way of measuring the ability of cancer patients to perform ordinary tasks. Scores range from 0 to 100. A higher score means the patient is better able to carry out daily activities. May be used to determine a patient's prognosis, to measure changes in a patientâ€™s ability to function, or to decide if a patient could be included in a clinical trial.
