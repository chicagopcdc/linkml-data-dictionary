| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| EBRT, 3D Conformal | A form of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in which doctors to sculpt radiation beams to the shape of a tumor and deliver to the tumor from several angles. |  |  |
| EBRT, Intensity-modulated | A form of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in which advanced software plans a precise dose of radiation, based on tumor size, shape and location. A computer-controlled device delivers the radiation in sculpted doses that match the 3-D geometrical shape of the tumor, including concave and complex shapes. The intensity of radiation beams can be adjusted across the treatment area in fractioned, separate beams as precision accuracy |  |  |
| EBRT, Stereotactic radiosurgery | A form of external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) in which a high dose of radiation is delivered to a small area in the brain or head from many angles. |  |  |
| EBRT, NOS | External beam radiation therapy (EBRT), subtype not otherwise specified |  |  |
| Unknown | Reported as unknown by the data contributor. | ncit:C17998 |  |
| Not Reported | Not provided or available. | ncit:C43234 |  |
