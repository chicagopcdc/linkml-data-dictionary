| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| Hemorrhage | In medicine, loss of blood from damaged blood vessels. A hemorrhage may be internal or external, and usually involves a lot of bleeding in a short time. | ncit:C26791 |  |
| Bacterial Infection | An acute infectious disorder that is caused by gram positive or gram negative bacteria; representative examples include pneumococcal, streptococcal, salmonella, and meningeal infections. | ncit:C2890 |  |
| Viral Infection | Any disease caused by a virus. | ncit:C3439 |  |
| Fungal Infection | An infection caused by a fungus. | ncit:C3245 |  |
| Infection, Not Otherwise Specified | The invasion of an organism's body tissues by disease-causing agents and their multiplication, as well as the reaction by the host to these organisms and/or toxins that the organisms produce. | ncit:C128320 |  |
| Immunotherapy-Related | An observation that a situation is related to immunotherapy received. | ncit:C168874 |  |
| Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome | A disorder characterized by inflammation and damage of the hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells of the hepatic venules that leads to venular occlusion and hepatocellular necrosis. It is most often a conditioning-related toxicity that results as a complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). It has also been described in populations of individuals who have ingested pyrrolizidine plant alkaloids. The clinical signs and symptoms include hyperbilirubinemia, hepatomegaly, and fluid retention. | ncit:C26793 |  |
| Multi-Organ Failure | Complete impairment of two or more organs or organ systems. | ncit:C75568 |  |
| Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome | Progressive and life-threatening pulmonary distress in the absence of an underlying pulmonary condition, usually following major trauma or surgery. Cases of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome are not included in this definition. | ncit:C3353 |  |
| Graft Versus Host Disease | A reaction, which may be fatal, in an immunocompromised subject (host) who has received an antigenically incompatible tissue transplant (graft) from an immunocompetent donor. The reaction is secondary to the activation of the transplanted cells against those host tissues that express an antigen not expressed by the donor, and is seen most commonly following bone marrow transplantation; acute disease is seen after 5-40 days, and chronic disease occurs weeks to months after transplantation. | ncit:C3063 |  |
| Other | Different than the one(s) previously specified or mentioned. | ncit:C17649 |  |
| Unknown | Reported as unknown by the data contributor. | ncit:C17998 |  |
| Not Reported | Not provided or available. | ncit:C43234 |  |
| Cardiac Failure | Inability of the heart to pump blood at an adequate rate to meet tissue metabolic requirements. Clinical symptoms of heart failure include: unusual dyspnea on light exertion, recurrent dyspnea occurring in the supine position, fluid retention or rales, jugular venous distension, pulmonary edema on physical exam, or pulmonary edema on chest x-ray presumed to be cardiac dysfunction. | ncit:C50577 |  |
| Infection, NOS | The invasion of an organism's body tissues by disease-causing agents and their multiplication, as well as the reaction by the host to these organisms and/or toxins that the organisms produce. | ncit:C128320 |  |
| Organ Failure, NOS | The failure of an essential system in the body. | ncit:C185320 |  |
| Cardiac Disease | A non-neoplastic or neoplastic disorder that affects the heart and/or the pericardium. Representative examples include endocarditis, pericarditis, atrial myxoma, cardiac myeloid sarcoma, and pericardial malignant mesothelioma. | ncit:C3079 |  |
| Pulmonary Disease | A non-neoplastic or neoplastic disorder affecting the lung. Representative examples of non-neoplastic disorders include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia. Representative examples of neoplastic disorders include benign processes (e.g., respiratory papilloma) and malignant processes (e.g., lung carcinoma and metastatic cancer to the lung). | ncit:C3198 |  |
| Surgical Complication | A disease or disorder that occurs during, soon after or as a result of a surgical procedure. | ncit:C164157 |  |
