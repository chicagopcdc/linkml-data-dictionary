## Permissible Values

| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| 3D Conformal | A process by which a dose of radiation is automatically shaped to closely conform to the entire volume of the tumor, so that surrounding normal tissue is spared and treatment toxicity is decreased. | ncit:C16035 |  |
| Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy | An advanced form of 3-Dimensional Conformal Radiation Therapy (3D CRT) that involves the use of varying intensities of small radiation beams to produce dosage distributions that are more precise than those possible with 3D CRT. | ncit:C16135 |  |
| Proton Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy | Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) that utilizes a proton beam. | ncit:C175032 |  |
| Photon Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy | Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) that utilizes a photon beam. | ncit:C175033 |  |
| Proton | A type of external beam radiation therapy using a beam of protons. It has the advantage of precisely localizing the radiation dose on the targeted tissue and avoiding damage to the healthy surrounding tissues. | ncit:C66897 |  |
| Photon | A single unit of electromagnetic radiation, generally considered to be a discrete particle having no mass or charge. | ncit:C88112 |  |
| Brachytherapy | A type of radiation therapy in which radioactive material is placed inside the body, into a tumor or body cavity. | ncit:C15195 |  |
| Other | Different than the one(s) previously specified or mentioned. | ncit:C17649 |  |
| Unknown | Reported as unknown by the data contributor. | ncit:C17998 |  |
| Not Reported | Not provided or available. | ncit:C43234 |  |
