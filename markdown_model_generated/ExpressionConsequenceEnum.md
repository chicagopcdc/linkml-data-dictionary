## Permissible Values

| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| Frameshift Mutation | A mutation occurring within the protein-coding region of a gene which results in a shift in the reading frame of the encoded protein. Frameshift mutations often result in the premature truncation of a gene product. | ncit:C17354 |  |
| Missense Mutation | A point mutation occurring within the protein-coding region of a gene, and which codes for a different amino acid than expected. | ncit:C18133 |  |
| Nonsense Mutation | A point mutation occurring within the protein-coding region of a gene, and which codes for a stop that can truncate the protein. | ncit:C62198 |  |
| Unknown | Reported as unknown by the data contributor. | ncit:C17998 |  |
| Not Reported | Not provided or available. | ncit:C43234 |  |
| Missense | Altering the genetic code in a way that produces an amino acid that is different from the usual amino acid at that position. Some missense mutations will alter the function of the protein. |  |  |
| Nonsense | Altering the genetic code in a way that causes the premature termination of a protein. The altered protein may be partially or completely inactivated, resulting in a change or loss of protein function. |  |  |
| Frameshift | Disrupting the triplet reading frame of a DNA sequence. Such mutations usually lead to the creation of a premature termination (stop) codon, and result in a truncated (shorter-than-normal) protein product. |  |  |
| Stop Gained | The gain of a premature termination codon (a stop was gained), which signals the end of translation |  |  |
| Stop Lost | The loss of a termination codon (a stop was lost), which removes the signal to end translation |  |  |
| Start Lost | The loss of a start codon (a start was lost), which removes the signal to start translation |  |  |
| Synonymous | No change in the amino acid resulting from the translation process |  |  |
| None (inframe) | The reading frame of the nucleotide sequence is not disrupted. |  |  |
