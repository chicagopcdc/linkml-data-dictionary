| Not Reported | Not provided or available. | ncit:C43234 |  |
| Ewing Sarcoma | A small round cell tumor that lacks morphologic, immunohistochemical, and electron microscopic evidence of neuroectodermal differentiation. It represents one of the two ends of the spectrum called Ewing sarcoma/peripheral neuroectodermal tumor. It affects mostly males under age 20, and it can occur in soft tissue or bone. Pain and the presence of a mass are the most common clinical symptoms. | ncit:C4817 |  |
| Undifferentiated Ewing Tumor | An undifferentiated soft tissue sarcoma characterized by the presence of uniform round or ovoid malignant cells with a high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio. | ncit:C121799 |  |
| Neuro-differentiated Ewing Tumor | A small round cell tumor with neural differentiation arising from the soft tissues or bone. | ncit:C9341 |  |
| Large Cell Ewing Tumor | Ewing sarcoma characterized by the presence of large malignant cells with prominent nucleoli and irregular contours. | ncit:C174456 |  |
| Seminoma/Dysgerminoma/Germinoma | A term that refers to germinoma, seminoma, or dysgerminoma. | ncit:C121618 |  |
| Embryonal Carcinoma | A non-seminomatous malignant germ cell tumor characterized by the presence of large germ cells with abundant cytoplasm resembling epithelial cells, geographic necrosis, high mitotic activity, and pseudoglandular and pseudopapillary structures formation. It can arise from the testis, ovary, and extragonadal sites (central nervous system and mediastinum). | ncit:C3752 |  |
| Yolk Sac Tumor | A non-seminomatous malignant germ cell tumor composed of primitive germ cells. It is the most common malignant germ cell tumor in the pediatric population. It occurs in the infant testis, ovary, sacrococcygeal region, vagina, uterus, prostate, abdomen, liver, retroperitoneum, thorax, and pineal/third ventricle. The tumor mimics the yolk sac of the embryo and produces alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Treatment includes: surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy. This tumor is very responsive to chemotherapy regimens that include cisplatinum. | ncit:C3011 |  |
| Choriocarcinoma | An aggressive malignant tumor arising from trophoblastic cells. The vast majority of cases arise in the uterus and represent gestational choriocarcinomas that derive from placental trophoblastic cells. Approximately half of the cases develop from a complete hydatidiform mole. A minority of cases arise in the testis or the ovaries. There is often marked elevation of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the blood. Choriocarcinomas disseminate rapidly through the hematogenous route; the lungs are most frequently affected. | ncit:C2948 |  |
| Mature Teratoma | A teratoma which may be cystic; it is composed entirely of well differentiated, adult-type mature tissues, without evidence of fetal-type immature tissues (grade 0 teratoma). | ncit:C9015 |  |
| Immature Teratoma | A teratoma characterized by the presence of an extensive component of immature, fetal-type tissues. | ncit:C4286 |  |
| Gonadoblastoma | A mixed germ cell/sex cord-stromal tumor characterized by the presence of large germ cells which resemble seminoma cells and small cells which resemble Sertoli or granulosa cells. It occurs in the testis and the ovary and is identified in children and adults. It is often associated with gonadal dysgenesis and abnormal karyotype. | ncit:C3754 |  |
| Somatic Malignancy | A teratoma which is characterized by morphologic transformation to malignancy and an aggressive clinical course. The malignant component most often is sarcomatous or carcinomatous. | ncit:C4289 |  |
| Necrotic Tumor | Necrotic Neoplasm | ncit:C36029 |  |
| Teratoma, NOS | A non-seminomatous germ cell tumor characterized by the presence of various tissues which correspond to the different germinal layers (endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm). It occurs in the testis, ovary, and extragonadal sites including central nervous system, mediastinum, lung, and stomach. According to the level of differentiation of the tissues which comprise the tumor, teratomas are classified as benign (grade 0 or 1), immature (grade 2), and malignant (grade 3). Grade 0 teratomas contain only mature elements; grade 1 teratomas have a limited degree of immaturity; grade 2 teratomas have a more extensive degree of immaturity; grade 3 teratomas are composed exclusively of immature tissues. The prognosis depends on patient age, tumor size and grade, and stage. | ncit:C3403 |  |
| Mixed Germ Cell Tumor | A malignant germ cell tumor characterized by the presence of at least two different germ cell tumor components. The different germ cell tumor components include choriocarcinoma, embryonal carcinoma, yolk sac tumor, teratoma, and seminoma. It occurs in the ovary, testis, and extragonadal sites including central nervous system and mediastinum. | ncit:C4290 |  |
| Malignant Teratoma | A teratoma composed exclusively of immature tissues. | ncit:C4287 |  |
| Seminoma | A radiosensitive malignant germ cell tumor found in the testis (especially undescended), and extragonadal sites (anterior mediastinum and pineal gland). It is characterized by the presence of uniform cells with clear or dense cytoplasm which contains glycogen, and by a large nucleus which contains one or more nucleoli. The neoplastic germ cells form aggregates separated by fibrous septa. The fibrous septa contain chronic inflammatory cells, mainly lymphocytes. | ncit:C9309 |  |
| Dysgerminoma | A malignant germ cell tumor characterized by the presence of a monotonous primitive germ cell population. The neoplastic cells form aggregates and have an abundant pale cytoplasm and uniform nuclei. The aggregates of the germ cells are separated by fibrous septa which contain inflammatory cells, mostly T-lymphocytes. It arises primarily in the ovaries, but can occur both primarily and secondarily at other sites, particularly the central nervous system. It responds to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Its prognosis is related to the tumor stage. | ncit:C2996 |  |
| Germinoma | A malignant germ cell tumor arising in the central nervous system. It is characterized by the presence of primitive, large malignant germ cells and lymphocytes. | ncit:C3753 |  |
| Other | Different than the one(s) previously specified or mentioned. | ncit:C17649 |  |

| Hodgkin Lymphoma, Nodular Lymphocyte Predominance | A monoclonal B-cell neoplasm characterized by a nodular, or a nodular and diffuse proliferation of scattered large neoplastic cells known as popcorn or lymphocyte predominant cells (LP cells)- formerly called L&H cells for lymphocytic and/or histiocytic Reed-Sternberg cell variants. The LP cells lack CD15 and CD30 in nearly all instances. Patients are predominantly male, frequently in the 30-50 year age group. Most patients present with limited stage disease (localized peripheral lymphadenopathy, stage I or II). (WHO 2008) | ncit:C7258 |  |
| Hodgkin Lymphoma, Nodular Sclerosis, NOS | A subtype of classic Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by collagen bands that surround at least one nodule, and Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg cells with lacunar type morphology. (WHO, 2008) | ncit:C3518 |  |
