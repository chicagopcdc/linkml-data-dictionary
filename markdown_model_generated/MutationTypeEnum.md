## Permissible Values

| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| Deletion, chromosomal | An incomplete chromosome. (Source: The Sequence Ontology)  | SO:1000029 |  |
| Deletion, NOS | The point at which one or more contiguous nucleotides were excised. (Source: The Sequence Ontology) Should be used when the type of deletion is not specified.  | SO:0000159 |  |
| Indel | A sequence alteration which included an insertion and a deletion, affecting 2 or more bases. (Source: The Sequence Ontology)  | SO:1000032 |  |
| Duplication, internal tandem | A duplication consisting of 2 identical adjacent regions. (Source: The Sequence Ontology)  | SO:1000173 |  |
| Duplication, chromosomal | An extra chromosome. (Source: The Sequence Ontology)  | SO:1000037 |  |
| Duplication, NOS | An insertion which derives from, or is identical in sequence to, nucleotides present at a known location in the genome. (Source: The Sequence Ontology)  | SO:1000035 |  |
| Insertion, NOS | The sequence of one or more nucleotides added between two adjacent nucleotides in the sequence. (Source: The Sequence Ontology)  | SO:0000667 |  |
| Translocation, chromosomal | A chromosomal mutation. Rearrangements that alter the pairing of telomeres are classified as translocations. (Source: The Sequence Ontology)  | SO:1000044 |  |
| Translocation, NOS | A region of nucleotide sequence that has translocated to a new position. The observed adjacency of two previously separated regions. (Source: The Sequence Ontology)  | SO:0000199 |  |
| Inversion, chromosomal | An interchromosomal mutation where a region of the chromosome is inverted with respect to wild type. (Source: The Sequence Ontology)  | SO:1000030 |  |
| Inversion, NOS | A continuous nucleotide sequence is inverted in the same position. (Source: The Sequence Ontology)  | SO:1000036 |  |
| Rearrangement, fusion | A sequence variant whereby a two genes have become joined. (Source: The Sequence Ontology)  | SO:0001565 |  |
| Substitution | A sequence alteration where the length of the change in the variant is the same as that of the reference. (Source: The Sequence Ontology)  | SO:1000002 |  |
| SNV, NOS | SNVs are single nucleotide positions in genomic DNA at which different sequence alternatives exist. (Source: The Sequence Ontology)  | SO:0001483 |  |
| Other | Different than the one(s) previously specified or mentioned.  | ncit:C17649 |  |
| Unknown | Reported as unknown by the data contributor.  | ncit:C17998 |  |
| Not Reported | Not provided or available. | ncit:C43234 |  |
