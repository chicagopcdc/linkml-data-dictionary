| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| Thyroid Disorder | A non-neoplastic or neoplastic disorder that affects the thyroid gland. Representative examples include hyperthyroidism, hypothyroidism, thyroiditis, follicular adenoma, and carcinoma. | ncit:C26893 |  |
| Gonadal Dysfunction | A non-neoplastic or neoplastic disorder that affects the testis or the ovary. | ncit:C26786 |  |
| Conduction abnormality | A disorder affecting the conduction system that sends electrical signals in the myocardium. | ncit:C78245 |  |
| Arrhythmia | Any variation from the normal rate or rhythm (which may include the origin of the impulse and/or its subsequent propagation) in the heart. | ncit:C2881 |  |
| Valvular Disease | Any heart disorder characterized by a defect in valve structure or function. | ncit:C45525 |  |
| Ventricular Dysfunction | Impairment of the ventricle to either fill or eject adequately. | ncit:C111655 |  |
| Pericarditis | An inflammatory process affecting the pericardium. | ncit:C34915 |  |
| Vascular Disorder | A non-neoplastic or neoplastic disorder affecting the arteries, veins, or lymphatic vessels. Examples include vasculitis, thrombophlebitis, arteriosclerosis, lymphedema, hemangioma, and angiosarcoma. | ncit:C35117 |  |
| Hypertension | Blood pressure that is abnormally high. | ncit:C3117 |  |
| Avascular-Necrosis | Tissue death resulting from an interruption to the blood supply. | ncit:C118385 |  |
| Osteopenia | Decreased calcification or density of bone tissue. | ncit:C50910 |  |
| Osteoporosis | A condition of reduced bone mass, with decreased cortical thickness and a decrease in the number and size of the trabeculae of cancellous bone (but normal chemical composition), resulting in increased fracture incidence. Osteoporosis is classified as primary (Type 1, postmenopausal osteoporosis; Type 2, age-associated osteoporosis; and idiopathic, which can affect juveniles, premenopausal women, and middle-aged men) and secondary osteoporosis (which results from an identifiable cause of bone mass loss). | ncit:C3298 |  |
| Scoliosis | A congenital or acquired spinal deformity characterized by lateral curvature of the spine. | ncit:C78603 |  |
| Arthritis | An inflammatory process affecting a joint. Causes include infection, autoimmune processes, degenerative processes, and trauma. Signs and symptoms may include swelling around the affected joint and pain. | ncit:C2883 |  |
| Musculoskeletal Hypoplasia | Underdevelopment or incomplete development of the musculoskeletal system. | ncit:C185696 |  |
| Neuropathy | A disorder affecting the cranial nerves or the peripheral nervous system. It manifests with pain, tingling, numbness, and muscle weakness. It may be the result of physical injury, toxic substances, viral diseases, diabetes, renal failure, cancer, and drugs. | ncit:C4731 |  |
| Neurocognitive | Having to do with the ability to think and reason. This includes the ability to concentrate, remember things, process information, learn, speak, and understand. | ncit:C94321 |  |
| Stroke | A sudden loss of neurological function secondary to hemorrhage or ischemia in the brain parenchyma due to a vascular event. | ncit:C3390 |  |
| Restrictive Lung Disease | Decreased lung volume and inadequate ventilation due to parenchymal lung disorders (e.g., interstitial pulmonary fibrosis) or extrapulmonary disorders (e.g., scoliosis). Patients present with shortness of breath and cough. | ncit:C91762 |  |
| Obstructive Lung Disease | A chronic and progressive lung disorder characterized by the loss of elasticity of the bronchial tree and the air sacs, destruction of the air sacs wall, thickening of the bronchial wall, and mucous accumulation in the bronchial tree. The pathologic changes result in the disruption of the air flow in the bronchial airways. Signs and symptoms include shortness of breath, wheezing, productive cough, and chest tightness. The two main types of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are chronic obstructive bronchitis and emphysema. | ncit:C3199 |  |
| Reactive Airway Disease | Coughing, wheezing, or shortness of breath that is triggered by allergens, infection, or other irritants. | ncit:C113673 |  |
| Pigment Changes | Abnormal skin pigmentation. | ncit:C124224 |  |
| Dryness | The lack of natural or normal moisture. | ncit:C25489 |  |
| Atrophy | Any weakening or degeneration, especially through lack of use. | ncit:C79748 |  |
| Contraction | Permanent contraction of a muscle as a result of spasm or paralysis. | ncit:C75585 |  |
| Scarring | A permanent mark left on the skin in the process of wound healing. | ncit:C34483 |  |
| Telengectasia | Local dilatation of small vessels resulting in red discoloration of the skin or mucous membranes. | ncit:C28194 |  |
| Renal Disorder | A neoplastic or non-neoplastic condition affecting the kidney. Representative examples of non-neoplastic conditions include glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome. Representative examples of neoplastic conditions include benign processes (e.g., renal lipoma and renal fibroma) and malignant processes (e.g., renal cell carcinoma and renal lymphoma). | ncit:C3149 |  |
| Bladder Disorder | A non-neoplastic or neoplastic disorder affecting the urinary bladder. A representative example of non-neoplastic bladder disorder is bacterial bladder infection. A representative example of neoplastic bladder disorder is bladder carcinoma. | ncit:C2900 |  |
| Autoimmune Reaction | A specific humoral or cell-mediated immune response against autologous (self) antigens. | ncit:C16313 |  |
| Acquired Immunodeficiency | A syndrome resulting from the acquired deficiency of cellular immunity caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It is characterized by the reduction of the Helper T-lymphocytes in the peripheral blood and the lymph nodes. Symptoms include generalized lymphadenopathy, fever, weight loss, and chronic diarrhea. Patients with AIDS are especially susceptible to opportunistic infections (usually pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections, tuberculosis, candida infections, and cryptococcosis), and the development of malignant neoplasms (usually non-Hodgkin lymphoma and Kaposi sarcoma). The human immunodeficiency virus is transmitted through sexual contact, sharing of contaminated needles, or transfusion of contaminated blood. | ncit:C2851 |  |
| GI Adhesions | A fibrous connection of tissue that joins together normally separate gastrointestinal regions. | ncit:C185688 |  |
| Pancreatitis | Inflammation of the pancreas. | ncit:C3306 |  |
| Hepatic Dysfunction | A finding that indicates abnormal liver function. | ncit:C50634 |  |
| Esophagitis | An acute or chronic inflammatory process affecting the esophageal wall. | ncit:C9224 |  |
| Gastritis | Inflammation of the stomach. | ncit:C26780 |  |
| Other | Different than the one(s) previously specified or mentioned. | ncit:C17649 |  |
