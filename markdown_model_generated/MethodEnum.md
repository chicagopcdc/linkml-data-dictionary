## Permissible Values

| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| Karyotyping | The assessment of the chromosomal morphology and number in somatic cells of an individual. | ncit:C25215 |  |
| Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization | A physical mapping approach that uses fluorescent tags to detect hybridization of probes within metaphase chromosomes or less condensed somatic interphase chromatin. This technique can be used for identification of chromosomal abnormalities and for gene mapping. | ncit:C17563 |  |
| RT-PCR | A laboratory procedure in which an RNA strand is first transcribed into a DNA complement and then subjected to PCR amplification. Transcribing an RNA strand into a DNA complement is termed reverse transcription and is done by the enzyme reverse transcriptase. | ncit:C18136 |  |
| Sequencing, NOS | Next Generation Sequencing, should be used as a default value if no other details about the NGS analysis is known. | ncit:C101293 |  |
| Other | Different than the one(s) previously specified or mentioned. | ncit:C17649 |  |
| Unknown | Reported as unknown by the data contributor. | ncit:C17998 |  |
| Not Reported | Not provided or available. | ncit:C43234 |  |
