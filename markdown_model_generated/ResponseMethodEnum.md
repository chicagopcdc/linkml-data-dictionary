## Permissible Values

| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| Imaging | Any technology or method that aids in the visualization of any biological process, cell, tissue or organ for use in screening, diagnosis, surgical procedures or therapy. | ncit:C17369 |  |
| Tumor Marker | A substance present in or produced by a tumor or by the host, that can be used for differentiating neoplastic from normal tissue based on measurements in body fluids, secretions, cells, and/or tissues. Markers are used in diagnosis, staging and prognosis of cancer, provide an estimation of tumor burden, and serve for monitoring effects of therapy, detecting recurrence, localization of tumors, and screening in general populations. | ncit:C17220 |  |
| Pathology | The medical science, and specialty practice, concerned with all aspects of disease, but with special reference to the essential nature, causes, and development of abnormal conditions, as well as the structural and functional changes that result from the disease processes. Informally used to mean the result of such an examination. | ncit:C18189 |  |
| PET | A technique for measuring the gamma radiation produced by collisions of electrons and positrons (anti-electrons) within living tissue. In positron emission tomography (PET), a subject is given a dose of a positron-emitting radionuclide attached to a metabolically active substance (for example, 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), which is similar to a naturally occurring sugar, glucose, with the addition of a radioactive fluorine atom). When living tissue containing the positron emitter is bombarded by electrons, gamma radiation produced by collisions of electrons and positrons is detected by a scanner, revealing in fine detail the tissue location of the metabolically-active substance administered. | ncit:C17007 |  |
| Gallium | An element with atomic symbol Ga, atomic number 31, and atomic weight 69.7. A rare silvery (usually trivalent) metallic element; brittle at low temperatures but liquid above room temperature; occurs in trace amounts in bauxite and zinc ores. | ncit:C66798 |  |
| CT | A method of examining structures within the body by scanning them with X rays and using a computer to construct a series of cross-sectional scans along a single axis. | ncit:C17204 |  |
| PET-CT | An imaging technique that utilizes positron emission tomography and computed tomography in a single machine. | ncit:C103512 |  |
| PET-MRI | An imaging technique that utilizes positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in a single machine. | ncit:C103514 |  |
| MRI | Imaging that uses radiofrequency waves and a strong magnetic field rather than x-rays to provide detailed pictures of internal organs and tissues. The technique is valuable for the diagnosis of many pathologic conditions, including cancer, heart and vascular disease, stroke, and joint and musculoskeletal disorders. | ncit:C16809 |  |
| X-Ray | A radiographic procedure using the emission of x-rays to form an image of the structure penetrated by the radiation. | ncit:C38101 |  |
| Bone Scan | A nuclear imaging method used to evaluate pathological bone metabolism. | ncit:C17646 |  |
| Bone Marrow Biopsy | A biopsy involving the removal of a core tissue containing bone spicules and hematopoietic elements embedded in the marrow stroma. This procedure is done in the hip area mainly for the diagnosis and evaluation of neoplastic and non-neoplastic hematopoietic disorders (e.g. anemias, leukemias, lymphomas) and the evaluation of the spread of solid tumors (e.g. carcinomas, sarcomas) and lymphomas for therapeutic purposes. | ncit:C15193 |  |
| Ultrasound | High frequency sound, generally with a frequency greater than 20,000 Hz. | ncit:C64384 |  |
| Unknown | Reported as unknown by the data contributor. | ncit:C17998 |  |
| Not Applicable | Determination of a value is not relevant in the current context. | ncit:C48660 |  |
| Not Reported | Not provided or available. | ncit:C43234 |  |
