Surgery done to help people who are obese lose weight. There are different types of weight loss surgery, and each type changes the way the digestive system works. Some types make the stomach smaller, which decreases the amount of food that it can hold so the person feels full sooner and eats less. Other types make changes to the stomach and the small intestine, which decreases the nutrients and calories that are absorbed from food. Weight loss surgery can improve many obesity-related health problems, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, unhealthy cholesterol levels, sleep apnea, and knee, hip, or other body pain. Having weight loss surgery may also decrease the risk of some cancers, including endometrial cancer. Also called bariatric surgery. (Source: NCI Dictionary of Cancer Terms)
