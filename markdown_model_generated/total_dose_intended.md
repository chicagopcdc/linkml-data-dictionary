# Slot: total_dose_intended


This is the total amount of medication that was intended to be administered either by trial protocol, by prescription, or other indicator at the time point of AGE_AT_MEDICATION_START. Often, this will be equal to TOTAL_DOSE_ADMINISTERED. If TOTAL_DOSE_ADMINISTERED and TOTAL_DOSE_INTENDED are different, this indicates a deviation from the protocol or plan and may be due to a variety of factors including patient intolerance, patient non-adherence, etc.
