| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| Amifostine | The trihydrate form of a phosphorylated aminosulfhydryl compound. After dephosphorylation of amifostine by alkaline phosphatase to an active free sulfhydryl (thiol) metabolite, the thiol metabolite binds to and detoxifies cytotoxic platinum-containing metabolites of cisplatin and scavenges free radicals induced by cisplatin and ionizing radiation. The elevated activity of this agent in normal tissues results from both the relative abundance of alkaline phosphatase in normal tissues and the greater vascularity of normal tissues compared to tumor tissues. | ncit:C488 |  |

Specifically, the agent inhibits nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, a protein that is constitutively activated in some cancers, thereby interfering with NF-kappaB-mediated cell survival, tumor growth, and angiogenesis. In vivo, bortezomib delays tumor growth and enhances the cytotoxic effects of radiation and chemotherapy. | ncit:C1851 |  |
| Brentuximab Vedotin | An antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) directed against the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor CD30 with potential antineoplastic activity. Brentuximab vedotin is generated by conjugating the chimeric anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody SGN-30 to the cytotoxic agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) via a valine-citrulline peptide linker. Upon administration and internalization by CD30-positive tumor cells, brentuximab vedotin undergoes enzymatic cleavage, releasing MMAE into the cytosol; MMAE binds to tubulin and inhibits tubulin polymerization, which may result in G2/M phase arrest and tumor cell apoptosis. Transiently activated during lymphocyte activation, CD30 (tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 8;TNFRSF8) may be constitutively expressed in hematologic malignancies including Hodgkin lymphoma and some T-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas.

Upon administration, gemcitabine is converted into the active metabolites difluorodeoxycytidine diphosphate (dFdCDP) and difluorodeoxycytidine triphosphate (dFdCTP) by deoxycytidine kinase. dFdCTP competes with deoxycytidine triphosphate (dCTP) and is incorporated into DNA. This locks DNA polymerase thereby resulting in "masked termination" during DNA replication. On the other hand, dFdCDP inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, thereby decreasing the deoxynucleotide pool available for DNA synthesis. The reduction in the intracellular concentration of dCTP potentiates the incorporation of dFdCTP into DNA. | ncit:C66876 |  |
| Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin | A recombinant, humanized anti-CD33 monoclonal antibody attached to the cytotoxic antitumor antibiotic calicheamicin. In this conjugate, the antibody binds to and is internalized by tumor cells expressing CD33 antigen (a sialic acid-dependent glycoprotein commonly found on the surface of leukemic blasts), thereby delivering the attached calicheamicin to CD33-expressing tumor cells.

FLT3, AXL and ALK, overexpressed or mutated in a variety of cancer cell types, play a key role in tumor cell growth and survival. | ncit:C116722 |  |
| Glembatumumab | A human monoclonal antibody against transmembrane glycoprotein non-metastatic melanoma protein B (GPNMB). Glembatumumab binds to GPNMB on cancer cells, but alone does not appear to inhibit cancer cell growth. However, this antibody could be utilized to deliver a conjugated cytotoxic agent to GPNMB-expressing tumor cells. GPNMB, overexpressed on the surface of various cancer cells, plays a key role in cancer cell proliferation. | ncit:C84520 |  |
| Hydrocortisone Sodium Succinate | The sodium salt of hydrocortisone succinate with glucocorticoid property. Hydrocortisone sodium succinate is chemically similar to the endogenous hormone that stimulates anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activities, in addition to exhibiting minor mineralocorticoid effects. This agent binds to intracellular glucocorticoid receptors and is translocated into the nucleus, where it initiates the transcription of glucocorticoid-responsive genes, such as various cytokines and lipocortins. Lipocortins inhibit phospholipase A2, thereby blocking the release of arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids and preventing the synthesis of prostaglandins and leukotrienes, both potent mediators of inflammation. | ncit:C1819 |  |
| Idarubicin | A semisynthetic 4-demethoxy analogue of the antineoplastic anthracycline antibiotic daunorubicin. | ncit:C562 |  |
