## Permissible Values

| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| Hyperthyroid | Overactivity of the thyroid gland resulting in overproduction of thyroid hormone and increased metabolic rate. Causes include diffuse hyperplasia of the thyroid gland (Graves' disease), single nodule in the thyroid gland, and thyroiditis. The symptoms are related to the increased metabolic rate and include weight loss, fatigue, heat intolerance, excessive sweating, diarrhea, tachycardia, insomnia, muscle weakness, and tremor. | ncit:C3123 |  |
| Hypothyroid | Abnormally low levels of thyroid hormone. | ncit:C26800 |  |
| Thyroid Nodule | A nodular lesion that develops in the thyroid gland. Causes include adenoma, thyroiditis, fluid-filled cyst, multinodular goiter, and carcinoma. | ncit:C3415 |  |
| Menstrual Cycle Dysfunction | A category of conditions related to menses. | ncit:C34815 |  |
| Germ Cell Failure, Suspected | Clinical suspicion for germ cell failure not proven with testing. | ncit:C185684 |  |
| Germ Cell Failure, Confirmed | A germ cell failure confirmed with testing. | ncit:C185685 |  |
| Testosterone Deficiency | A disorder characterized by low testosterone. | ncit:C143195 |  |
| Fertility Disorder | Inability to conceive for at least one year after trying and having unprotected sex. Causes of female infertility include endometriosis, fallopian tubes obstruction, and polycystic ovary syndrome. Causes of male infertility include abnormal sperm production or function, blockage of the epididymis, blockage of the ejaculatory ducts, hypospadias, exposure to pesticides, and health related issues. | ncit:C3836 |  |
| Ammenorrhea | The absence of menses in a woman who has achieved reproductive age. | ncit:C61443 |  |
| Heart Block | A disorder characterized by an electrocardiographic finding of complete failure of atrial electrical impulse conduction to the ventricles. This is manifested on the ECG by disassociation of atrial and ventricular rhythms. The atrial rate must be faster than the ventricular rate. (CDISC) | ncit:C50501 |  |
| Prolonged QT | An electrocardiographic finding in which the QT interval not corrected for heart rate is prolonged. Thresholds for different age, gender, and patient populations exist. | ncit:C71034 |  |
| Supraventricular Tachycardia | A disorder characterized by an electrocardiographic finding of a tachycardia which does not originate in the ventricles or His Purkinje system. There is an abnormally high heart rate and QRS complexes are typically narrow, but aberration or preexcitation may be present. | ncit:C35061 |  |
| Cardiomyopathy, NOS | A disease of the heart muscle or myocardium proper. Cardiomyopathies may be classified as either primary or secondary, on the basis of etiology, or on the pathophysiology of the lesion: hypertrophic, dilated, or restrictive. | ncit:C34830 |  |
| Restrictive Cardiomyopathy | A type of heart disorder referring to the inability of the ventricles to fill with blood because the myocardium (heart muscle) stiffens and looses its flexibility. Causes include replacement of the myocardium with scar tissue, abnormal cellular infiltration of the myocardium, or deposition of a substance (e.g., amyloid) in the myocardium. | ncit:C62798 |  |
| Dilated Cardiomyopathy | Cardiomyopathy which is characterized by dilation and contractile dysfunction of the left and right ventricles. It may be idiopathic, or it may result from a myocardial infarction, myocardial infection, or alcohol abuse. It is a cause of congestive heart failure. | ncit:C84673 |  |
| Sensory Neuropathy | Inflammation or degeneration of the sensory nerves. | ncit:C3501 |  |
| Motor Neuropathy | Inflammation or degeneration of the peripheral motor nerves. | ncit:C3500 |  |
| Pulmonary Fibrosis | Chronic progressive interstitial lung disorder characterized by the replacement of the lung tissue by connective tissue, leading to progressive dyspnea, respiratory failure, or right heart failure. Causes include chronic inflammatory processes, exposure to environmental irritants, radiation therapy, autoimmune disorders, certain drugs, or it may be idiopathic (no identifiable cause). | ncit:C26869 |  |
| Asthma | A chronic respiratory disease manifested as difficulty breathing due to the narrowing of bronchial passageways. | ncit:C28397 |  |
| Decreased Creatinine Clearance | A laboratory test finding that indicates decreased creatinine clearance. | ncit:C185671 |  |
| Tubular Damage | Damage to the renal tubules. | ncit:C185689 |  |
| AKI | Sudden and sustained deterioration of the kidney function characterized by decreased glomerular filtration rate, increased serum creatinine or oliguria. | ncit:C26808 |  |
| Decreased GFR | A laboratory test result which indicates a decreased glomerular filtration rate. | ncit:C78326 |  |
| AIN | A condition characterized by the autoantibody-induced destruction of neutrophils. | ncit:C176730 |  |
| Other | Different than the one(s) previously specified or mentioned. | ncit:C17649 |  |
