## Permissible Values

| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| Flow cytometry | A technique for counting, examining and sorting microscopic particles suspended in a stream of fluid. | ncit:C16585 |  |
| Morphology | The science of the form and structure of organisms (plants, animals, and other forms of life), or of their parts, and the study or science of the same. In pathology, the specific appearance of cells and tissues (normal and abnormal) under the light or electron microscope. | ncit:C17943 |  |
| MicroRNA Sequencing | A next-generation or massively parallel high-throughput DNA sequencing-based procedure that can identify and quantify the microRNA sequences present in a biological sample. | ncit:C156057 |  |
| PCR | A method for amplifying a DNA base sequence using multiple rounds of heat denaturation of the DNA and annealing of oligonucleotide primers complementary to flanking regions in the presence of a heat-stable polymerase. This results in duplication of the targeted DNA region. Newly synthesized DNA strands can subsequently serve as additional templates for the same primer sequences, so that successive rounds of primer annealing, strand elongation, and dissociation produce rapid and highly specific amplification of the desired sequence. PCR also can be used to detect the existence of the defined sequence in a DNA sample. | ncit:C17003 |  |
| qPCR | An application of PCR that measures the products generated during each cycle of the polymerase chain reaction process in order to determine the starting amount of template in the reaction. | ncit:C51962 |  |
| ddPCR | A type of digital polymerase chain reaction technique in which the sample is fractionated into thousands of tiny droplets using a water-oil emulsion droplet technology, within which individual PCR reactions occur in each droplet | ncit:C166064 |  |
| Cytology | The light microscopic study of normal and abnormal cells in fine needle aspirates (FNAs), body cavity fluids, and smears. | ncit:C16491 |  |
| Unknown | Reported as unknown by the data contributor. | ncit:C17998 |  |
| Not Reported | Not provided or available. | ncit:C43234 |  |
