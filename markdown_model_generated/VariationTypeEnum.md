| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| Chromosome Arm-Level Aneuploidy (CAA) | Chromosome arm aneuploidy (CAA) is characterized by copy number gain or loss of chromosome arms. CAA is the most prevalent type of genomic alteration in solid tumors, occurring in 90% of cases  |  |  |
| Deletion | The point at which one or more contiguous nucleotides were excised. (Source: The Sequence Ontology) Should be used when the type of deletion is not specified. | ncit:C19296 |  |
| Translocation | A region of nucleotide sequence that has translocated to a new position. The observed adjacency of two previously separated regions. (Source: The Sequence Ontology) | ncit:C3420 |  |
| Translocation, Balanced | Interchanges of genetic material among different chromosomes following the breaking off of pieces of chromosomes such that the total chromosome composition may still contain all of the genetic material.Balanced Chromosomal Rearrangement. | ncit:C6822 |  |
| Translocation, Unbalanced | Interchanges of genetic material among different chromosomes following the breaking off of pieces of chromosomes such that the total chromosome composition does not contain all of the genetic material. | ncit:C6823 |  |
| Inversion | A continuous nucleotide sequence is inverted in the same position. (Source: The Sequence Ontology) | ncit:C45589 |  |
| Rearrangement | Any genetic rearrangement that is not otherwise specified. | ncit:C36541 |  |
| SNV, NOS | SNVs are single nucleotide positions in genomic DNA at which different sequence alternatives exist. (Source: The Sequence Ontology) | ncit:C164674 |  |
| Mutation, NOS | Any genetic mutation that is not otherwise specified. | ncit:C45576 |  |
| Other | Different than the one(s) previously specified or mentioned.  | ncit:C17649 |  |
| Unknown | Reported as unknown by the data contributor. | ncit:C17998 |  |
| Not Reported | Not provided or available. | ncit:C43234 |  |
| Isochromosome | Isochromosomes are chromosomes composed of mirror images of one of the arms of the chromosome. |  |  |
| Insertion | The sequence of one or more nucleotides added between two adjacent nucleotides in the sequence. (Source: The Sequence Ontology) | SO:0000667 |  |
| Substitution | A sequence alteration where the length of the change in the variant is the same as that of the reference. (Source: The Sequence Ontology) | SO:1000002 |  |
| Rearrangement, Fusion | A sequence variant whereby a two genes have become joined. (Source: The Sequence Ontology) | SO:0001565 |  |
| Duplication, Internal Tandem | A duplication consisting of 2 identical adjacent regions. (Source: The Sequence Ontology) | SO:1000173 |  |
| Duplication | An insertion which derives from, or is identical in sequence to, nucleotides present at a known location in the genome. (Source: The Sequence Ontology) | SO:1000035 |  |
| Chromosome arm-level aneuploidy (CAA), NOS | An incomplete chromosome. (Source: The Sequence Ontology) | SO:1000029 |  |
