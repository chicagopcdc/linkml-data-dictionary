| AML with t(8;21)(q22;q22.1); RUNX1-RUNX1T1 | An acute myeloid leukemia with t(8;21)(q22; q22.1) giving rise to RUNX1/RUNX1T1 fusion transcript and showing maturation in the neutrophil lineage. The bone marrow and the peripheral blood show large myeloblasts with abundant basophilic cytoplasm, often containing azurophilic granules. This type of AML is associated with good response to chemotherapy and high complete remission rate. | ncit:C9288 |  |
| AML with inv(16)(p13.1q22) or t(16;16)(p13.1;q22); CBFB-MYH11 | An acute myeloid leukemia with monocytic and granulocytic differentiation and the presence of a characteristically abnormal eosinophil component in the bone marrow. This type of acute myeloid leukemia has a favorable prognosis. (WHO, 2001) | ncit:C9287 |  |

Morphologically it usually has monocytic features. It may present at any age but it is more commonly seen in children. Patients may present with disseminated intravascular coagulation. | ncit:C82403 |  |
| AML with t(6;9)(p23;q34.1);DEK-NUP214 | An acute myeloid leukemia associated with t(6;9)(p23;q34.1) resulting in DEK-NUP214(CAN) fusion protein expression. It is often associated with multilineage dysplasia and basophilia. It affects both children and adults and it usually has an unfavorable clinical outcome. | ncit:C82423 |  |
| AML with inv(3)(q21.3q26.2) or t(3;3)(q21.3;q26.2); GATA2, MECOM | An acute myeloid leukemia associated with inv(3)(q21.3q26.2) or t(3;3)(q21.3;q26.2) resulting in the reposition of a distal GATA2 enhancer to activate MECOM expression. It may present de novo or follow a myelodysplastic syndrome. The clinical course is aggressive. | ncit:C82426 |  |
| AML (megakaryoblastic) with t(1;22)(p13.3;q13.3); RBM15-MKL1 | An acute myeloid leukemia associated with t(1;22)(p13.3;q13.1) resulting in the expression of RBM15-MKL1 fusion protein. It affects infants and children and usually shows megakaryocytic maturation. | ncit:C82427 |  |
| Provisional entity: AML with BCR-ABL1 | A rare, de novo acute myeloid leukemia in which the blasts harbor BCR-ABL1 translocation in the absence of a history and clinical and laboratory features of chronic myelogenous leukemia. | ncit:C129785 |  |
| AML with mutated NPM1 | An acute myeloid leukemia with mutation of the nucleophosmin gene. It is usually associated with normal karyotype and frequently has myelomonocytic or monocytic features. It usually responds to induction therapy. | ncit:C82431 |  |
| AML with biallelic mutations of CEBPA | An acute myeloid leukemia with double mutations of the CEBPA gene. | ncit:C129782 |  |
| Provisional entity: AML with mutated RUNX1 | De novo acute myeloid leukemia with RUNX1 gene mutation, not associated with myelodysplastic syndrome-related cytogenetic abnormalities. | ncit:C129786 |  |
| AML with myelodysplasia-related changes | Acute Myeloid Leukemia with Myelodysplasia-Related Changes | ncit:C7600 |  |
| Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms | Acute myeloid leukemias, myelodysplastic syndromes, and myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms arising as a result of the mutagenic effect of chemotherapy agents and/or radiation that are used for the treatment of neoplastic or non-neoplastic disorders. | ncit:C27912 |  |
| AML, NOS | Acute myeloid leukemias that do not fulfill the criteria for inclusion in the group of acute myeloid leukemias which have recurrent genetic abnormalities or myelodysplastic changes, or are therapy-related. This category includes entities classified according to the French-American-British classification scheme. | ncit:C27753 |  |
| AML with minimal differentiation | Acute Myeloid Leukemia with Minimal Differentiation | ncit:C8460 |  |
| AML without maturation | An acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in which the blasts do not show evidence of myeloid differentiation by morphology and conventional cytochemistry. (WHO, 2001) | ncit:C3249 |  |
| AML with maturation | An acute myeloid leukemia (AML) characterized by blasts with evidence of maturation to more mature neutrophils. (WHO, 2001) | ncit:C3250 |  |
| Acute myelomonocytic leukemia | An acute leukemia characterized by the proliferation of both neutrophil and monocyte precursors. (WHO, 2001) | ncit:C7463 |  |
| Acute monoblastic/monocytic leukemia | Acute myeloid leukemia in which 80% or more of the leukemic cells are of monocytic lineage, including monoblasts, promonocytes, and monocytes. Bleeding disorders are common presenting features. | ncit:C7318 |  |
| Pure erythroid leukemia | Acute erythroid leukemia characterized by the presence of immature erythroid cells in the bone marrow (at least 80% of the cellular component), without evidence of a significant myeloblastic cell population present. | ncit:C7467 |  |
| Acute megakaryoblastic leukemia | An acute myeloid leukemia in which at least 50% of the blasts are of megakaryocytic lineage. (WHO, 2001) | ncit:C3170 |  |
| Acute basophilic leukemia | A rare acute myeloid leukemia in which the immature cells differentiate towards basophils. | ncit:C3164 |  |

| Myeloid proliferations related to Down syndrome | Myeloid neoplasms occurring in individuals with Down syndrome. There is an increased risk of acute leukemias in both children and adults with Down syndrome. In particular, the incidence of acute myeloid leukemia in Down syndrome children of less than five years of age is particularly high, it is usually an acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, and is associated with GATA1 gene mutation. This group of disorders also includes the entity transient abnormal myelopoiesis which occurs in neonates and is associated with GATA1 gene mutation. | ncit:C82338 |  |
| Transient abnormal myelopoiesis (TAM) | A myeloid proliferation occurring in newborns with Down syndrome. It is clinically and morphologically indistinguishable from acute myeloid leukemia and is associated with GATA1 mutations. The blasts display morphologic and immunophenotypic features of megakaryocytic lineage. In the majority of patients the myeloid proliferation undergoes spontaneous remission. | ncit:C82339 |  |
| Myeloid leukemia associated with Down syndrome | Acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome occurring in children with Down syndrome. The acute myeloid leukemia is usually an acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, and is associated with GATA1 gene mutation. | ncit:C43223 |  |
