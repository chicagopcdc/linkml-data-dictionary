| PET | A technique for measuring the gamma radiation produced by collisions of electrons and positrons (anti-electrons) within living tissue. In positron emission tomography (PET), a subject is given a dose of a positron-emitting radionuclide attached to a metabolically active substance (for example, 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), which is similar to a naturally occurring sugar, glucose, with the addition of a radioactive fluorine atom). When living tissue containing the positron emitter is bombarded by electrons, gamma radiation produced by collisions of electrons and positrons is detected by a scanner, revealing in fine detail the tissue location of the metabolically-active substance administered. | ncit:C17007 |  |
| Gallium | An element with atomic symbol Ga, atomic number 31, and atomic weight 69.7. A rare silvery (usually trivalent) metallic element; brittle at low temperatures but liquid above room temperature; occurs in trace amounts in bauxite and zinc ores. | ncit:C66798 |  |
| CT | A method of examining structures within the body by scanning them with X rays and using a computer to construct a series of cross-sectional scans along a single axis. | ncit:C17204 |  |
| PET-CT | An imaging technique that utilizes positron emission tomography and computed tomography in a single machine. | ncit:C103512 |  |
| PET-MRI | An imaging technique that utilizes positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in a single machine. | ncit:C103514 |  |
| MRI | Imaging that uses radiofrequency waves and a strong magnetic field rather than x-rays to provide detailed pictures of internal organs and tissues. The technique is valuable for the diagnosis of many pathologic conditions, including cancer, heart and vascular disease, stroke, and joint and musculoskeletal disorders. | ncit:C16809 |  |
| X-ray | A radiographic procedure using the emission of x-rays to form an image of the structure penetrated by the radiation. | ncit:C38101 |  |
| Ultrasound | High frequency sound, generally with a frequency greater than 20,000 Hz. | ncit:C64384 |  |
| Bone scan | A nuclear imaging method used to evaluate pathological bone metabolism. | ncit:C17646 |  |
