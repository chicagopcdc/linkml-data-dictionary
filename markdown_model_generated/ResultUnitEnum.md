| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| % | A unit for expressing a number as a fraction of hundred (on the basis of a rate or proportion per hundred). | ncit:C48570 |  |
| count/mm3 | A count of items per cubic millimeter of sample. | ncit:C173275 |  |
| g/dL | A unit of mass concentration defined as the concentration of one gram of a substance per unit volume of the mixture equal to one deciliter (100 milliliters). The concept also refers to the metric unit of mass density (volumic mass) defined as the density of substance which mass equal to one gram occupies the volume one deciliter. | ncit:C64783 |  |
| U/L | An arbitrary unit of substance concentration equal to the concentration at which one liter of mixture contains one unit of a substance. | ncit:C67456 |  |
| mm/h | A unit of both speed (scalar) and velocity (vector), defined as the distance of one millimeter travelled per unit time equal to one hour. | ncit:C67419 |  |
| mg/L | A metric unit of mass concentration defined as the concentration of one gram of a substance per unit volume of the mixture equal to one cubic meter. The concept also refers to the metric unit of mass density (volumic mass) defined as the density of a substance which mass equal to one gram occupies the volume of one cubic meter. | ncit:C64572 |  |
| Unknown | Reported as unknown by the data contributor. | ncit:C17998 |  |
| Not Reported | Not provided or available. | ncit:C43234 |  |
| ng/mL | A unit of mass concentration defined as the concentration of one microgram of a substance per unit volume of the mixture equal to one liter. The concept also refers to the unit of mass density (volumetric mass) defined as the density of a substance which mass equal to one microgram occupies the volume of one liter. | ncit:C67306 |  |
| IU/L | Unit of arbitrary substance concentration (biologic activity concentration) defined as the concentration of one international unit per one liter of the system volume. | ncit:C67376 |  |
| uIU/mL | Unit of arbitrary substance concentration (biologic activity concentration) defined as the concentration of one millionth of international unit per one milliliter of system volume. | ncit:C67405 |  |
| mcg/mL | A metric unit of mass concentration defined as the concentration of one gram of a substance per unit volume of the mixture equal to one cubic meter. The concept also refers to the metric unit of mass density (volumic mass) defined as the density of a substance which mass equal to one gram occupies the volume of one cubic meter. | ncit:C64572 |  |
| seconds | A unit of time, one of the seven base units of the International System of Units (Systeme International d'Unites, SI). The second is the duration of 919 263 177 0 periods of the specified light radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the caesium 133 atom in its ground state at 0 K. According to the convention, 60 seconds constitute one minute; 3,600 seconds constitute one hour. | ncit:C42535 |  |
| g/L | A SI derived unit of mass concentration defined as the concentration of one kilogram of a substance per unit volume of the mixture equal to one cubic meter, or the concentration of one milligram of a substance per unit volume of the mixture equal to one milliliter, or one gram of a substance per one liter of the mixture. It is also a unit of mass density (volumic mass) defined as the density of substance which mass equal to one milligram occupies the volume one milliliter. | ncit:C42576 |  |
| umol/L | A unit of concentration (molarity unit) equal to one one-millionth of a mole (10E-6 mole) of solute per one liter of solution. | ncit:C48508 |  |
| mmol/L | A unit of concentration (molarity unit) equal to one thousandth of a mole (10E-3 mole) of solute per one liter of solution. | ncit:C64387 |  |
| mL/min | A metric unit of volumetric flow rate defined as the rate at which one milliliter of matter crosses a given surface during the period of time equal to one minute. | ncit:C64777 |  |
| mIU/L | Unit of arbitrary substance concentration (biologic activity concentration) defined as the concentration of one millionth of international unit per one milliliter of system volume. | ncit:C67405 |  |
