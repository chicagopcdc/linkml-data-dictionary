| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| CNS1 | The status of central nervous system leukemia at diagnosis, where there is an absence of blasts on a cerebral spinal fluid cytospin preparation, regardless of the number of white blood cells. | ncit:C116833 |  |
| CNS2 | The status of central nervous system leukemia at diagnosis, where there are less than 5 white blood cells per microliter on a cerebral spinal fluid cytospin preparation that is positive for blasts; or greater than 5 white blood cells per microliter on a cerebral spinal fluid cytospin preparation that is considered negative by Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm. | ncit:C116834 |  |
| CNS3 | The status of central nervous system leukemia at diagnosis, where there are more than 5 white blood cells per microliter on a cerebral spinal fluid cytospin preparation that is positive for blasts; with or without clinical signs of CNS leukemia. | ncit:C116835 |  |
| CNS2a | The status of central nervous system leukemia at diagnosis, where there are less than 10 red blood cells and less than 5 white blood cells per microliter on a cerebral spinal fluid cytospin preparation that is positive for blasts. | ncit:C116836 |  |
| CNS2b | The status of central nervous system leukemia at diagnosis, where there are 10 or more red blood cells and less than 5 white blood cells per microliter on a cerebral spinal fluid cytospin preparation that is positive for blasts. | ncit:C116837 |  |
| CNS2c | The status of central nervous system leukemia at diagnosis, where there are 10 or more red blood cells and 5 or more white blood cells per microliter on a cerebral spinal fluid cytospin preparation that is positive for blasts and is considered negative by Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm. | ncit:C116838 |  |
| CNS3a | The status of central nervous system leukemia at diagnosis, where there are less than 10 red blood cells and 5 or more white blood cells per microliter on a cerebral spinal fluid cytospin preparation that is positive for blasts. | ncit:C116840 |  |
| CNS3b | The status of central nervous system leukemia at diagnosis, where there are 10 or more red blood cells and 5 or more white blood cells per microliter on a cerebral spinal fluid cytospin preparation that is considered positive by Steinherz/Bleyer algorithm. | ncit:C116841 |  |
| CNS3c | The status of central nervous system leukemia at diagnosis, where there are clinical signs of central system leukemia (such as facial nerve palsy, brain/eye involvement, or hypothalamic syndrome). | ncit:C116843 |  |
