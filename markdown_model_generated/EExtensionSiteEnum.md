| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| Chest Wall | The total system of structures outside the lungs that move as a part of breathing; it includes all structures from the skin to the parietal pleura. | ncit:C62484 |  |
| Heart | A hollow organ located slightly to the left of the middle portion of the chest. It is composed of muscle and it is divided by a septum into two sides: the right side which receives de-oxygenated blood from the body and the left side which sends newly oxygenated blood to the body. Each side is composed of two chambers: the atrium (receiving blood) and ventricle (ejecting blood). | ncit:C12727 |  |
| Lungs | One of a pair of viscera occupying the pulmonary cavities of the thorax, the organs of respiration in which aeration of the blood takes place. As a rule, the right lung is slightly larger than the left and is divided into three lobes (an upper, a middle, and a lower or basal), while the left has two lobes (an upper and a lower or basal). Each lung is irregularly conical in shape, presenting a blunt upper extremity (the apex), a concave base following the curve of the diaphragm, an outer convex surface (costal surface), an inner or mediastinal surface (mediastinal surface), a thin and sharp anterior border, and a thick and rounded posterior border. | ncit:C12468 |  |
