| kg | A basic SI unit of mass. It is defined as the mass of an international prototype in the form of a platinum-iridium cylinder kept at Sevres in France. A kilogram is equal to 1,000 grams and 2.204 622 6 pounds. | ncit:C28252 |  |
| cm | A basic unit of length in the former CGS version of metric system, equal to one hundredth of a meter or approximately 0.393 700 787 inch | ncit:C49668 |  |
| m2 | A SI unit of area measurement equal to a square whose sides are one meter long. Square meter is equal to 10,000 square centimeters; 0.01 are; 1.196 square yards; 10.76 square feet; 1550 square inches. | ncit:C42569 |  |
| mmHg | A non-SI unit of pressure equal to 133,332 Pa or 1.316E10-3 standard atmosphere. Use of this unit is generally deprecated by ISO and IUPAC. | ncit:C49670 |  |
| beat/min | The number of heartbeats measured per minute time. | ncit:C49673 |  |
| C | A unit of temperature of the temperature scale designed so that the freezing point of water is 0 degrees and the boiling point is 100 degrees at standard atmospheric pressure. The current official definition of the Celsius sets 0.01 C to be at the triple point of water and a degree to be 1/273.16 of the difference in temperature between the triple point of water and absolute zero. One degree Celsius represents the same temperature difference as one Kelvin. | ncit:C42559 |  |
| kg/m2 | The SI derived unit of spread rate of a substance by mass, used also as a measure of area density and as a dose calculation unit. | ncit:C49671 |  |
| Unknown | Reported as unknown by the data contributor. | ncit:C17998 |  |
| Not Reported | Not provided or available. | ncit:C43234 |  |
