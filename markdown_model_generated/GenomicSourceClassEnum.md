## Permissible Values

| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| Germline | Any mutation that appears in the gametes and which will therefore be transmitted to the progeny with some frequency. (Source NCIt) | ncit:C17666 |  |
| Somatic | Any mutation with an origin in cells that are not destined to become gametes. As a consequence, such mutations are not transmitted to progeny, though they will be transmitted during any mitosis within the individual. Somatic mutations may contribute to a broad variety of pathologies including cancer. (Source NCIt) | ncit:C18060 |  |
| Unknown | Reported as unknown by the data contributor. | ncit:C17998 |  |
| Not Reported | Not provided or available. | ncit:C43234 |  |
| Somatic Mosaic | The occurrence of two genetically distinct populations of cells within an individual, derived from a postzygotic mutation. |  |  |
| Unknown Genomic Origin | The unknown origins of the genes in a cell or organism. |  |  |
