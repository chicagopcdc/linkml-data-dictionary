| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| Biopsy | The removal of tissue specimens or fluid from the living body for microscopic examination, performed to establish a diagnosis. | ncit:C15189 |  |
| Staging Laparotomy | Creation of a surgical opening into the abdominal cavity. | ncit:C15266 |  |
| Lymphangiogram | An x-ray image of the lymphatic system using a radiopaque imaging agent. | ncit:C16805 |  |
| Gallium Scan | A nuclear imaging procedure in which gallium-67 is used as the radiopharmaceutical. Gallium binds to transferrin, leukocyte lactoferrin, bacterial siderophores and inflammatory proteins and thereby can be used to localize foci of infection. It is also taken up by several tumors, thus gallium scintigraphy can be used for the staging of tumors. | ncit:C38087 |  |
| CT Scan | A method of examining structures within the body by scanning them with X rays and using a computer to construct a series of cross-sectional scans along a single axis. | ncit:C17204 |  |
| PET Scan | A technique for measuring the gamma radiation produced by collisions of electrons and positrons (anti-electrons) within living tissue. In positron emission tomography (PET), a subject is given a dose of a positron-emitting radionuclide attached to a metabolically active substance (for example, 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG), which is similar to a naturally occurring sugar, glucose, with the addition of a radioactive fluorine atom). When living tissue containing the positron emitter is bombarded by electrons, gamma radiation produced by collisions of electrons and positrons is detected by a scanner, revealing in fine detail the tissue location of the metabolically-active substance administered. | ncit:C17007 |  |
| PET-CT | An imaging technique that utilizes positron emission tomography and computed tomography in a single machine. | ncit:C103512 |  |
| PET-MRI | An imaging technique that utilizes positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging in a single machine. | ncit:C103514 |  |
| Ultrasound | High frequency sound, generally with a frequency greater than 20,000 Hz. | ncit:C64384 |  |
| MRI | Imaging that uses radiofrequency waves and a strong magnetic field rather than x-rays to provide detailed pictures of internal organs and tissues. The technique is valuable for the diagnosis of many pathologic conditions, including cancer, heart and vascular disease, stroke, and joint and musculoskeletal disorders. | ncit:C16809 |  |
| X-Ray | A radiographic procedure using the emission of x-rays to form an image of the structure penetrated by the radiation. | ncit:C38101 |  |
| Bone Scan | A nuclear imaging method used to evaluate pathological bone metabolism. | ncit:C17646 |  |
| Physical Examination | A systemic evaluation of the body and its functions using visual inspection, palpation, percussion and auscultation. The purpose is to determine the presence or absence of physical signs of disease or abnormality for an individual's health assessment. | ncit:C20989 |  |
| Other | Different than the one(s) previously specified or mentioned. | ncit:C17649 |  |
| Unknown | Reported as unknown by the data contributor. | ncit:C17998 |  |
| Not Reported | Not provided or available. | ncit:C43234 |  |
