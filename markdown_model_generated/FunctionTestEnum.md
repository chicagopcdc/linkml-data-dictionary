| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| MUGA Scan | A multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan and a form of radionuclide imaging that provides a comprehensive look at blood flow and the function of the lower chambers of the heart ventricles. | ncit:C38073 |  |
| Echocardiography | A test that uses high-frequency sound waves (ultrasound) to create an image of the heart. | ncit:C16525 |  |
| Ejection Fraction | The fraction of the left ventricular end diastolic volume ejected with each beat. The left ventricular ejection fraction is equal to the left ventricular stroke volume divided by the left ventricular end diastolic volume. | ncit:C99524 |  |
| Shortening Fraction | The fraction of the left ventricle diastolic dimension that is lost during systole; the measurement is calculated using the following formula: (end-diastolic dimension - end-systolic dimension) / end-diastolic dimension; the quotient is then multiplied by one hundred to be expressed as a percent. | ncit:C38020 |  |
| QTc | The time interval between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave in the cardiac cycle as corrected with a non-specified correction formula. | ncit:C100391 |  |
| FVC | The maximum volume of air that can be exhaled after forced maximum inhalation. | ncit:C111361 |  |
| FEV1 | A test of lung function, the FEV1 is the volume exhaled during the first second of a forced expiratory maneuver started from the level of total lung capacity. It is the most frequently used index for assessing bronchoconstriction or bronchodilatation. | ncit:C38084 |  |
| FEF at 25-75% | The mean forced expiratory flow rate at 25-75% of the forced vital capacity as a proportion of the predicted normal value. | ncit:C119546 |  |
| Total lung capacity | The total volume of air in the lungs after maximum inhalation. | ncit:C111325 |  |
| DLCO | A measurement of carbon monoxide (CO) transfer from inspired gas to pulmonary capillary blood. During the test, the subject inspires a gas containing CO and one or more tracer gases to allow determination of the gas exchanging capability of the lungs. | ncit:C38083 |  |
