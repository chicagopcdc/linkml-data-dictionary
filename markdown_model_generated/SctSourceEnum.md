## Permissible Values

| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| Bone Marrow | A procedure to replace diseased or pathologic bone marrow with transplanted healthy bone marrow cells. | ncit:C15194 |  |
| Peripheral Blood | A method of hematopoietic reconstitution utilizing stem cells harvested from the circulating blood of a patient or donor. Peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (PBSCT) is used for the treatment of certain blood disorders, following partial or complete bone marrow ablation, or following high dose chemotherapy or radiation treatment for cancer. Immature circulating blood cells, similar to stem cells in the bone marrow, are removed before treatment. The cells are then given to the patient after treatment to help the bone marrow recover and continue producing healthy blood cells. Transplantation may be autologous (the patient's own blood cells are used), allogeneic (blood cells are donated by someone else), or syngeneic (blood cells are donated by an identical twin). | ncit:C15430 |  |
| Cord Blood | A therapeutic procedure that involves the transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells collected from the umbilical cord or placenta. | ncit:C15640 |  |
| Mixture of Stem Cells | A mixture of different sources of stem cells. | ncit:C168886 |  |
