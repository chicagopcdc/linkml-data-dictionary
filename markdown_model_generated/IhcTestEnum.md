| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| CD30 | Tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 8 (595 aa, ~ 64 kDa) is encoded by the human TNFRSF8 gene. This protein is involved in ligand-mediated signal transduction, the positive regulation of apoptosis and the inhibition of cell proliferation. | ncit:C38906 |  |
| beta-catenin | Catenin beta-1 (781 aa, ~85 kDa) is encoded by the human CTNNB1 gene. This protein is involved in Wnt signaling, adherens junction structure, and the regulation of cell growth. | ncit:C17478 |  |
| GPC3 | Glypican-3 (580 aa, ~66 kDa) is encoded by the human GPC3 gene. This protein is involved in the mediation of proteoglycan binding to the cell surface. | ncit:C88175 |  |
| CD20 | B-lymphocyte antigen CD20 (297 aa, ~33 kDa) is encoded by the human MS4A1 gene. This protein plays a role in both the activation and proliferation of B-cells. | ncit:C38896 |  |
| LMP1 | Latent membrane protein 1 (386 aa, ~42 kDa) is encoded by the Epstein-Barr virus LMP1 gene. This protein is involved in both the activation of nuclear factor-kappa-B family signaling pathways and the inhibition of apoptosis of infected B-lymphocytes. | ncit:C18863 |  |
| EBER | Small non-coding RNA that is encoded by Epstein-Barr virus DNA and transcribed by virally-infected cells throughout the latent cycle. Expression of these oligonucleotides may be associated with the regulation of host ribosome function. | ncit:C111618 |  |
| PAS | This is an all-round useful stain for many things, including glycogen, mucin, mucoprotein, glycoprotein, as well as fungi. The reaction is based on the oxidation of glycol group to aldehydes by periodate. The schiff's reagent selectively stains the aldehydes to a rose pink color. PAS is useful for outlining tissue structures--basement membranes, capsules, blood vessels, etc. | ncit:C23019 |  |
| S100 | A family of low molecular weight proteins that are characterized by the presence of two EF-hand calcium binding domains. These proteins form homodimers that localize either in the cytoplasm or nucleus of neural crest-derived cells and are involved in the regulation of many cellular processes such as cell cycle progression and differentiation. | ncit:C29924 |  |
| NSE | Gamma-enolase (434 aa, ~47 kDa) is encoded by the human ENO2 gene. This protein is involved in glycolysis, neurotrophy and neuroprotection. | ncit:C62216 |  |
| Vimentin | Vimentin (466 aa, ~54 kDa) is encoded by the human VIM gene. This protein plays a role in the localization of organelles and other cellular components. | ncit:C48797 |  |
| Desmin | Desmin (470 aa, ~54 kDa) is encoded by the human DES gene. This protein is involved in the regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics in muscle cells. | ncit:C96450 |  |
| CD99 | CD99 antigen (185 aa, ~19 kDa) is encoded by the human CD99 gene. This protein plays a role in cell adhesion. | ncit:C102941 |  |
| FLI-1 | Friend leukemia integration 1 transcription factor (452 aa, ~51 kDa) is encoded by the human FLI1 gene. This protein plays a role in the modulation of transcription. | ncit:C18566 |  |
| CD45 | Receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase C (1304 aa, ~147 kDa) is encoded by the human PTPRC gene. This protein plays a role in protein dephosphorylation. | ncit:C17282 |  |
