| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| Pathogenic | A genetic variant that is known to directly contribute to the development of disease. | ncit:C168799 |  |
| Likely pathogenic | A genetic variant that is known to have a high likelihood (greater than 90% certainty) to contribute to the development of a disease. | ncit:C168800 |  |
| Uncertain significance | A variation in a genetic sequence whose association with disease risk is unknown. | ncit:C94187 |  |
| Likely benign | A genetic variant that is not expected to contribute to the development of a disease, but the scientific evidence may be insufficient to prove this conclusively. | ncit:C168801 |  |
