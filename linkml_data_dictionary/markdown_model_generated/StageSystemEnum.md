| AIDS-Related Kaposi Sarcoma Stage | A term that refers to the staging of AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma according to the AIDS Clinical Trials Group system. The latter incorporates the extent of tumor (T), the status of the immune system (I), as measured by the number of CD4 cells present in the blood, and the extent of involvement within the body or systemic illness (S). Under each major heading, there are 2 subgroups: either a 0 (good risk) or a 1 (poor risk) group. (American Cancer Society) | ncit:C134969 |  |
| AJCC v6 Stage | A cancer stage defined according to the AJCC 6th edition criteria. | ncit:C90529 |  |
| AJCC v7 Stage | A cancer stage defined according to the AJCC 7th edition criteria. | ncit:C90530 |  |
| AJCC v8 Stage | A cancer stage defined according to the AJCC 8th edition criteria. | ncit:C132248 |  |
| Ann Arbor | A lymphoma anatomic stage defined according to the Ann Arbor classification criteria. | ncit:C141138 |  |
| Children's Oncology Group Liver Tumor Staging System | A staging system developed by Children's Oncology Group (COG) that categorizes liver tumors based on the size and extent of the tumor. | ncit:C177630 |  |
| Children's Oncology Group Neuroblastoma Risk Group Staging System | A staging system that categorizes treatment intensity for patients with neuroblastoma on the basis of risk (prognostic) factors defined by Children's Oncology Group (COG). | ncit:C177631 |  |
| Children's Oncology Group Renal Cancer Staging System | A staging system developed by Children's Oncology Group (COG) that categorizes renal tumors, often Wilms tumor, based on the size and extent of the tumor. | ncit:C177632 |  |
| Children's Oncology Group Retinoblastoma Risk Group Staging System | A staging system that categorizes treatment intensity for patients with retinoblastoma on the basis of risk (prognostic) factors defined by Children's Oncology Group (COG). | ncit:C177633 |  |
| Children's Oncology Group | An NCI-supported clinical cooperative group formed by the merger of the four national pediatric cancer research organizations: the Children's Cancer Group, the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group, the National Wilms Tumor Study Group, and the Pediatric Oncology Group. The primary objective of the organization is to conduct clinical trials of new therapies for childhood and adolescent cancer. COG develops and coordinates clinical trials conducted at the 238 member institutions that include cancer centers of all major universities and teaching hospitals throughout the U.S. and Canada, as well as sites in Europe and Australia. COG members include over 5000 cancer researchers. | ncit:C39353 |  |
| Childrens Oncology Group/National Wilms Tumor Study Group Staging System | A staging system for Wilms' Tumor that is based on the postoperative, pre-chemotherapy pathological features and findings relating to the extent of tumor spread. | ncit:C140271 |  |
| Enneking Staging System | A staging system for malignant mesenchymal tumors that takes into account the surgical grade, local extent, and presence or absence of metastasis. | ncit:C140258 |  |
| EVANS | A staging system for neuroblastoma proposed by Evans, based on both the site of origin and the clinical behavior of the tumor. | ncit:C85407 |  |
| FIGO | A set of staging terms for carcinoma developed by the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO). | ncit:C125738 |  |
| Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study Group Clinical Staging and Grouping System | Staging and grouping for rhabdomyosarcoma that groups patients into low, intermediate, or high clinical risk groups based on: histologic type, tumor site, tumor size, and pathologic TNM. Note: this is not the TNM system described in AJCC. | ncit:C148010 |  |
| INRGSS | A clinical staging system for neuroblastoma based on preoperative imaging and determined prior to any treatment, including surgery. It includes two stages of localized disease (L1 and L2) and two stages of metastatic disease (M and MS). | ncit:C133427 |  |
| INSS | A surgicopathological staging system for neuroblastoma, based on the Evans staging system. | ncit:C85416 |  |
| International Society of Pediatric Oncology Staging System | A staging system for Wilms' Tumor that is based on the extent of tumor spread at surgery, after the patient has received neo-adjuvant chemotherapy. | ncit:C140270 |  |
| Lugano Stage | An adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma and adult and childhood Hodgkin lymphoma stage defined according to the Lugano classification criteria. | ncit:C141147 |  |
| Pediatric Oncology Group Neuroblastoma Staging System | A clinicopathological staging system for neuroblastoma, which places emphasis on the presence or absence of regional lymph node involvement by tumor. | ncit:C85423 |  |
| PRETEXT Staging System | A staging system designed by the International Childhood Liver Tumor Strategy Group (SIOPEL) for staging and risk stratification of liver tumors. A PRETEXT stage number is based on the number of contiguous liver sections not involved by tumor, corresponding to a rough estimate of the difficulty of the expected surgical procedure. It is used to describe tumor extent before any therapy, thus allowing more effective comparison between studies conducted by different groups. | ncit:C141133 |  |
| Reese-Ellsworth Staging System | A staging system for intraocular retinoblastoma that was developed in the 1960s, when children were treated with external beam radiation therapy. This system can help determine the likelihood of preserving the vision while the tumor is being treated. It is divided into 5 stages, and each stage predicts the potential to save the eye with external beam radiation therapy. Today, radiation therapy is reserved as a last resort to save a second eye, when all other treatments have failed. As a result, the Reese-Ellsworth classification is now rarely used. | ncit:C123333 |  |
| St. Jude Stage | A stage defined according to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital staging system for childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma. | ncit:C141216 |  |
| TNM Staging System | A system for clinicopathologic evaluation of tumors based on the extent of tumor involvement at the primary site (T, followed by a number indicating size and depth of invasion), and lymph node involvement (N) and metastasis (M) each followed by a number starting at 0 for no evident metastasis; numbers used depend on the organ involved and influence the prognosis and choice of treatment. | ncit:C25384 |  |
| AJCC | A group formed for the purpose of developing a system of clinical staging for cancer that is acceptable to the American medical profession and is compatible with other accepted classifications. | ncit:C39315 |  |
