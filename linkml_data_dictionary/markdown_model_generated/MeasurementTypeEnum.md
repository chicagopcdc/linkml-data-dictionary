## Permissible Values

| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| Weight | The weight of a subject. | ncit:C81328 |  |
| Height | The vertical measurement or distance from the base to the top of a subject or participant. | ncit:C164634 |  |
| BMI | The result of a body mass index measurement. | ncit:C138901 |  |
| BSA | A measure of the 2-dimensional extent of the body surface (i.e., the skin). Body surface area (BSA) can be calculated by mathematical formula or from a chart that relates height to weight. BSA is often an important factor in dosing. | ncit:C25157 |  |
| Head Circumference | A circumferential measurement of the head at the widest point, which is traditionally above the eyebrows. | ncit:C81255 |  |
| Unknown | Reported as unknown by the data contributor. | ncit:C17998 |  |
| Not Reported | Not provided or available. | ncit:C43234 |  |
| Pulse | The rhythmic wave within the arteries occurring with each contraction of the left ventricle. | ncit:C25749 |  |
| Systolic Blood Pressure | The maximum pressure exerted into the systemic arterial circulation during the contraction of the left ventricle of the heart. | ncit:C25298 |  |
| Diastolic Blood Pressure | The minimum pressure exerted into the systemic arterial circulation during cardiac ventricular relaxation and filling. | ncit:C25299 |  |
| Respiratory Rate | The rate of breathing (inhalation and exhalation) measured within in a unit time, usually expressed as breaths per minute. | ncit:C49678 |  |
| Temperature | A measure of the average kinetic energy of a system of particles. Temperature may be quantified, in the context of thermodynamics, as the potential of one system to transfer thermal energy to another system until both systems reach a state of thermal equilibrium. | ncit:C25206 |  |
