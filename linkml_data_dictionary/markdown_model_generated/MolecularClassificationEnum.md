| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| CNS Neuroblastoma, FOXR2-Activated | A rare central nervous system embryonal neoplasm with neuroblastic and/or neuronal differentiation. It is characterized by the presence of structural rearrangements of FOXR2 gene that result in the activation of the transcription factor FOXR2. | ncit:C186547 |  |
| CNS Tumor With BCOR Internal Tandem Duplication | A rare central nervous system embryonal tumor characterized by the presence of uniform oval or spindle-shaped cells with round or oval nuclei, pseudorosette formation, and heterozygous internal tandem duplication in exon 15 of the BCOR gene. | ncit:C186556 |  |
| Other | Different than the one(s) previously specified or mentioned. | ncit:C17649 |  |
