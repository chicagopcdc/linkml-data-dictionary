| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| Rhabdomyosarcoma | A rare aggressive malignant mesenchymal neoplasm arising from skeletal muscle. It usually occurs in children and young adults. Only a small percentage of tumors arise in the skeletal muscle of the extremities. The majority arise in other anatomic sites. | ncit:C3359 |  |
| Sarcoma, NOS | A usually aggressive malignant neoplasm of the soft tissue or bone. It arises from muscle, fat, fibrous tissue, bone, cartilage, and blood vessels. Sarcomas occur in both children and adults. The prognosis depends largely on the degree of differentiation (grade) of the neoplasm. Representative subtypes are liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and chondrosarcoma. | ncit:C9118 |  |
| Adenocarcinoma | A common cancer characterized by the presence of malignant glandular cells. Morphologically, adenocarcinomas are classified according to the growth pattern (e.g., papillary, alveolar) or according to the secreting product (e.g., mucinous, serous). Representative examples of adenocarcinoma are ductal and lobular breast carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma (hepatoma), colon adenocarcinoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma. | ncit:C2852 |  |
| Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumor | A malignant neoplasm that originates in the neuroectoderm. The neuroectoderm constitutes the portion of the ectoderm of the early embryo that gives rise to the central and peripheral nervous systems and includes some glial cell precursors. | ncit:C3716 |  |
| Squamous Cell Carcinoma | A carcinoma arising from squamous epithelial cells. Morphologically, it is characterized by the proliferation of atypical, often pleomorphic squamous cells. Squamous cell carcinomas are graded by the degree of cellular differentiation as well, moderately, or poorly differentiated. Well differentiated carcinomas are usually associated with keratin production and the presence of intercellular bridges between adjacent cells. Representative examples are lung squamous cell carcinoma, skin squamous cell carcinoma, and cervical squamous cell carcinoma. | ncit:C2929 |  |
| Malignant Histiocytosis | An antiquated term referring to cases of systemic non-Hodgkin lymphomas which are composed of large, atypical neoplastic lymphoid cells and cases of hemophagocytic syndromes. In the past, cases of anaplastic large cells lymphoma were called malignant histiocytosis. | ncit:C7202 |  |
| Other | Different than the one(s) previously specified or mentioned. | ncit:C17649 |  |
| Unknown | Reported as unknown by the data contributor. | ncit:C17998 |  |
| Not Reported | Not provided or available. | ncit:C43234 |  |
