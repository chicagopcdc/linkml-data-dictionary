## Permissible Values

| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| Score 1 | The results of the positron emission tomography are negative; there is no detectable abnormal tracer uptake. | ncit:C99728 |  |
| Score 2 | The results of the positron emission tomography are negative; the tracer uptake is less than or equal to the mediastinum. | ncit:C99747 |  |
| Score 3 | The results of the positron emission tomography are negative; the tracer uptake is greater than the mediastinum but less than or equal to the liver. | ncit:C99748 |  |
| Score 4 | The results of the positron emission tomography are positive; the tracer uptake is moderately more than the liver uptake, at any disease site. | ncit:C99749 |  |
| Score 5 | The results of the positron emission tomography are positive; the tracer uptake is markedly increased at any disease site. | ncit:C99750 |  |
