## Permissible Values

| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| Diffusion Weighted Imaging | A diffusion MRI technique in which diffusion-sensitizing gradients are applied to the imaging sequence. | ncit:C111116 |  |
| FLAIR | A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) pulse sequence that uses an inversion recovery technique to null fluids present in the imaging area, improving clarity of the object of interest. | ncit:C82392 |  |
| MRI T1 with Gadolinium | T1 weighted magnetic resonance imaging done with the addition of a contrast agent to enhance tissues. | ncit:C180728 |  |
| MRI T2 | A method of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that creates contrast between tissues based on differences in the transverse relaxation of a tissue's net magnetization vector; it measures the time taken for spinning protons to lose phase coherence among the nuclei spinning perpendicular to the main field. This MRI sequence is produced by using a longer time to echo (TE) and repetition time (TR) than a T1-weighted sequence. | ncit:C180729 |  |
| Unknown | Reported as unknown by the data contributor. | ncit:C17998 |  |
| Not Reported | Not provided or available. | ncit:C43234 |  |
