# Slot: time_period_number


This variable indicates the ordinal numbering of time periods of the same TIME_PERIOD_TYPE within its various subgroups (e.g., Relapse 1, Relapse 2, Relapse 3, etc.). The observations across domains can therefore be organized longitudinally without the need for specific dates.
