## Permissible Values

| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| Left Ventricular Systolic Dysfunction | The degree of impairment of the left cardiac ventricle to contract efficiently. (ACC) | ncit:C64251 |  |
| Infection | The invasion of an organism's body tissues by disease-causing agents and their multiplication, as well as the reaction by the host to these organisms and/or toxins that the organisms produce. | ncit:C128320 |  |
| Sinusoidal Obstruction Syndrome | A disorder characterized by inflammation and damage of the hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells of the hepatic venules that leads to venular occlusion and hepatocellular necrosis. It is most often a conditioning-related toxicity that results as a complication of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). It has also been described in populations of individuals who have ingested pyrrolizidine plant alkaloids. The clinical signs and symptoms include hyperbilirubinemia, hepatomegaly, and fluid retention. | ncit:C26793 |  |
| Typhlitis | Inflammation of the cecum, usually accompanied by neutropenia. | ncit:C38043 |  |
| Multi Organ Failure | Complete impairment of two or more organs or organ systems. | ncit:C75568 |  |
| Hyperbilirubinemia | Abnormally high level of bilirubin in the blood. Excess bilirubin is associated with jaundice. | ncit:C27088 |  |
| Hemorrhage | The flow of blood from a ruptured blood vessel. | ncit:C26791 |  |
| Neurotoxicity Syndrome | A group of neurologic disorders caused by damage to the nervous system following exposure to pharmacologic, biologic, and chemical agents. Examples of neurotoxins include chemotherapy agents, radiation treatment, heavy metals, pesticides, and food additives. | ncit:C27961 |  |
| Graft Versus Host Disease | A reaction, which may be fatal, in an immunocompromised subject (host) who has received an antigenically incompatible tissue transplant (graft) from an immunocompetent donor. The reaction is secondary to the activation of the transplanted cells against those host tissues that express an antigen not expressed by the donor, and is seen most commonly following bone marrow transplantation; acute disease is seen after 5-40 days, and chronic disease occurs weeks to months after transplantation. | ncit:C3063 |  |
| Other | Different than the one(s) previously specified or mentioned. | ncit:C17649 |  |
| Unknown | Reported as unknown by the data contributor. | ncit:C17998 |  |
| Not Reported | Not provided or available. | ncit:C43234 |  |
| Treatment, NOS | Inflammation of the cecum, usually accompanied by neutropenia. | ncit:C38043 |  |
| Renal Toxicity | Toxicity that impairs or damages the kidney. This condition is often caused by the administration of a pharmaceutical agent that causes damage to the kidney. | ncit:C115459 |  |
| Neuropathy | A disorder affecting the cranial nerves or the peripheral nervous system. It manifests with pain, tingling, numbness, and muscle weakness. It may be the result of physical injury, toxic substances, viral diseases, diabetes, renal failure, cancer, and drugs. | ncit:C4731 |  |
| Pulmonary Toxicity | Toxicity that impairs or damages the lung(s). This condition is often caused by the administration of a pharmaceutical agent that causes damage to the lungs. | ncit:C177374 |  |
| Ototoxicity | Damage to the inner ear as a result of exposure to drugs or chemicals. | ncit:C66929 |  |
| Allergic reaction | An immune response that occurs following re-exposure to an innocuous antigen, and that requires the presence of existing antibodies against that antigen. This response involves the binding of IgE to mast cells, and may worsen with repeated exposures. | ncit:C114476 |  |
| Mucositis | Inflammation of the mucous membranes. | ncit:C115965 |  |
| Neutropenia | A decrease in the number of neutrophils in the peripheral blood. | ncit:C80520 |  |
| Thrombocytopenia | A laboratory test result indicating that there is an abnormally small number of platelets in the circulating blood. | ncit:C3408 |  |
| Hepatic Toxicity | Toxicity that impairs or damages the liver. | ncit:C185645 |  |
| Cardiac Toxicity | Toxicity that impairs or damages the heart. This condition is often caused by the administration of a pharmaceutical agent that initiates a poisonous or toxic response in cardiac tissue. | ncit:C27994 |  |
| GI toxicity | Toxicity that impairs or damages the gastrointestinal system. | ncit:C185646 |  |
| Rashes | Any change in the skin which affects its appearance or texture. A rash may be localized to one part of the body, or affect all the skin. Rashes may cause the skin to change color, itch, become warm, bumpy, dry, cracked or blistered, swell and may be painful. | ncit:C39594 |  |
| Endocrine toxicity | Indicates that a toxicity adverse effect has been experienced during endocrine drug treatment. | ncit:C138163 |  |
| Musculoskeletal toxicity | A toxicity that impairs or damages the musculoskeletal system. | ncit:C185647 |  |
| Fatigue | Overall tiredness and lack of energy. | ncit:C3036 |  |
