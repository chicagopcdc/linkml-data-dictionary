## Permissible Values

| Text | Description | Meaning | Other Information |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | ---: |
| Intraocular Mass(es) | A lump or collection of cohering particles within the eyeball. |  |  |
| Orbital Finding - Etiology Not Clear | Abnormal growths of tissue in the structures that surround the orbit of the eye with unknown cause. |  |  |
| Suspected Lymph Node involvement | A suspected finding indicating the spread of cancer to regional or distant lymph node(s). |  |  |
| Distant Metastasis | A biological process that involves the transfer and growth of cancer cells from the site of the primary tumor. Relocation of malignant cells during metastasis can be restricted to movement within a specific tissue/organ or may entail migration to a distal locus within the body. This phenotype is a characteristic of all malignant tumors. | ncit:C18206 |  |
| Pineal Gland Tumor | A neoplasm arising from the pineocyte, a cell with photosensory and neuroendocrine functions. It may be composed of mature elements or primitive, immature cells. The cellular composition determines the biological behavior and clinical outcome. Three types are recognized: pineoblastoma, pineocytoma, and pineal parenchymal tumor of intermediate differentiation (Adapted from WHO.) | ncit:6965 |  |
| Pineal Gland Cyst | A fluid filled sac within the pineal gland. It is usually an incidental finding of no real clinical significance. | ncit:C9483 |  |
| Optic Nerve Enhancement | Abnormality of the optic nerve. |  |  |
| Optic Nerve Thickening | A reaction to a buildup of pressure in or around your brain that may have many causes. |  |  |
| Orbital Cellulitis | Inflammation of the eye tissues posterior to the orbital septum, and generally secondary to an infection spread from adjacent sinuses. Signs and symptoms of the affected eye include sudden loss of vision, erythema, edema, decreased eye movement, and pain. Treatment is conducted via intravenous antibiotics, observation, and surgical intervention when necessary. | ncit:C99000 |  |
| Subluxation of Lens | Lens that are subluxed when it is partially displaced but remains within the lens space. |  |  |
| Suspected Orbital Extension of RB | A suspected clinically or radiologically detection of orbital extension of an intraocular retinoblastoma at the initial presentation, with or without proptosis or a fungating mass. |  |  |
| Suspected Optic Nerve Extension of RB | A suspected clinically or radiologically detection of orbital nerve extension of an intraocular retinoblastoma at the initial presentation, with or without proptosis or a fungating mass. |  |  |
| Other | Different than the one(s) previously specified or mentioned. | ncit:C17649 |  |
| Unknown | Reported as unknown by the data contributor. | ncit:C17998 |  |
| Not Reported | Not provided or available. | ncit:C43234 |  |
